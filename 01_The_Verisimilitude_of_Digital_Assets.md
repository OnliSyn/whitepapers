## Abstract

Blockchain technology creates the appearance of a financial system without the contractual and legal foundations that define actual finance. This synthesis of peer-reviewed academic research, central bank papers, and authoritative institutional sources demonstrates that cryptocurrencies fail to meet formal definitions of financial assets, operate as infrastructure-sharing schemes rather than financial systems, suffer from pervasive market manipulation, and generate speculative rather than productive value—all while consuming extraordinary resources and concentrating power despite decentralization claims. The evidence reveals a fundamental disconnect: **blockchain replicates the surface features of financial markets (trading, price discovery, ledgers) without the underlying contractual reality, legal enforcement mechanisms, and productive utility that characterize legitimate financial instruments.** What emerges is verisimilitude—a convincing but ultimately hollow simulation of finance.

## 1. Introduction: The Verisimilitude Thesis

Blockchain technology and its most prominent application, cryptocurrency, have captured global attention with narratives of decentralization, trustless interaction, and a new financial paradigm. Proponents claim it represents a fundamental revolution in how value is created, stored, and exchanged. However, a rigorous examination of the evidence from academic, regulatory, and institutional sources reveals a profound disconnect between this narrative and the operational reality of blockchain systems. This paper argues that blockchain does not create a new type of financial system but rather a **verisimilitude** of one—a highly convincing simulation that mimics the appearance of finance without possessing its essential, underlying substance.

This verisimilitude is built on a category error: mistaking a distributed database for a financial market, a cryptographic token for a financial asset, and a consensus mechanism for financial intermediation. While blockchain technology successfully creates a system for maintaining a decentralized ledger, it fails to replicate the legal, contractual, and economic foundations that give financial assets their meaning and utility. The result is a system that appears to function like a financial market but is, in reality, an infrastructure-sharing scheme for database maintenance, dominated by speculative dynamics, market manipulation, and extreme centralization of power.

This paper synthesizes evidence from over two dozen peer-reviewed studies, central bank reports, and institutional analyses to deconstruct this verisimilitude. We will demonstrate that:

1.  **Financial assets require contractual claims and legal enforcement**, which blockchain tokens lack.
2.  **Miners and validators sell database maintenance services**, not financial intermediation.
3.  **Triple-entry accounting claims misrepresent** what are essentially distributed double-entry systems.
4.  **Wash trading constitutes 25-95% of reported volume**, creating an illusion of liquidity and value.
5.  **Bitcoin consumes extraordinary energy resources** for minimal productive output.
6.  **Mining pools, exchanges, and development show extreme centralization**, contradicting the core narrative.
7.  **Greater Fool Theory dynamics dominate valuation**, as cryptocurrencies lack intrinsic value or cash flows.

By examining each of these dimensions, we will prove that blockchain technology, in its current form, has not created a new financial system but rather a compelling illusion of one. This distinction is critical for investors, regulators, and technologists seeking to build the future of finance on a foundation of reality, not simulation.

## 2. Financial Assets Require Contractual Claims and Legal Enforcement

The foundational error in classifying cryptocurrencies as financial assets is a misunderstanding of what a financial asset *is*. According to authoritative institutional sources, a financial asset is not merely a digital entry but a legally enforceable contractual claim. The **International Monetary Fund's (IMF) *Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual* (2000)** provides the definitive definition: "Most financial assets are financial claims arising from contractual relationships entered into when one institutional unit provides funds to another" [1]. This definition is echoed by the **European Central Bank (ECB)**, which defines a financial asset as a contractual right to receive cash or another financial instrument [2]. The **IMF's *Balance of Payments Manual* (BPM7)** reinforces this, stating that "Claims arise from contractual relationships entered into when one institutional unit promises to provide funds or other resources to another in the future" [3].

This contractual foundation is not a trivial detail; it is the very essence of a financial asset. It creates a debtor/creditor relationship and a bundle of legal rights that can be enforced through a legal system. Academic research confirms the centrality of legal enforcement. A 2005 study in the *Quarterly Journal of Economics* by Lerner and Schoar found that private equity investments in countries with strong legal enforcement have higher valuations and returns, as legal protections reduce risk and enable more sophisticated financial contracting [4]. As Katharina Pistor argues in her "Legal Theory of Finance," financial assets are fundamentally legal constructs whose value depends on their legal vindication [5].

Cryptocurrencies, by design, lack this contractual foundation. A Bitcoin holder has no legal claim against any issuer, no contractual right to receive payment, and no recourse through the courts if the token's value disappears. They are bearer instruments without an issuer, a legal impossibility in modern finance. Even gold, often cited as an analogue, is classified as a commodity precisely because it lacks a contractual claim structure [6]. Cryptocurrencies, therefore, do not fit the definition of a financial asset. They are entries in a database, not legally enforceable claims.

This distinction has profound implications for accounting treatment, regulatory classification, and corporate adoption. When an entity holds a financial asset, it records both the asset and the corresponding claim structure on its balance sheet. The asset's value is tied to the creditworthiness of the issuer and the enforceability of the contract. With cryptocurrency, there is no issuer to assess, no credit risk to manage in the traditional sense, and no legal mechanism to recover value if the network fails or the keys are lost. This is why accounting standards bodies like the IFRS and FASB classify cryptocurrencies as intangible assets rather than financial instruments—they lack the fundamental characteristic of a contractual claim.

Moreover, the absence of legal recourse creates a fundamental asymmetry between cryptocurrency and traditional financial assets. If a bank fails to honor a deposit, the depositor can sue. If a bond issuer defaults, bondholders have legal claims on the issuer's assets. If a cryptocurrency network is compromised, or if keys are stolen or lost, there is no legal remedy. The holder's only recourse is to hope that the network's consensus mechanism remains intact and that their private keys remain secure. This is not a financial system—it is a trust-minimized database with no legal backstop.

## 3. Miners and Validators Sell Database Maintenance Services, Not Financial Intermediation

If cryptocurrencies are not financial assets, what is the economic activity of a blockchain network? The evidence suggests that it is not financial intermediation but rather a technology service: **database maintenance**. The **Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago** described blockchain as "essentially a new approach to database architecture" where miners and validators provide consensus services [7]. This is not financial intermediation, which involves credit creation, risk assessment, and maturity transformation. Miners and validators are paid—through block rewards and transaction fees—to order transactions, validate them against network rules, and maintain a consistent version of the database. They are technology service providers in an infrastructure-sharing scheme [8, 9, 10].

This distinction is critical. Financial intermediaries create economic value through productive lending and risk management. Blockchain networks, in contrast, create value only through the maintenance of their own internal ledger. The tokens themselves represent no claim on productive assets, generate no cash flows, and have no economic value beyond the network's internal accounting system. This is why the **New York Fed** describes blockchain networks as "novel payment systems"—a form of infrastructure, not a new class of asset [11].

The economic model of blockchain is fundamentally that of a shared infrastructure service. Participants pay fees to have their transactions included in the ledger, and miners/validators compete to provide this service in exchange for rewards. This is analogous to paying a cloud computing provider for database services, not to engaging with a financial intermediary. The confusion arises because the database happens to record token balances, creating the illusion of a financial system. But recording balances is not the same as creating financial assets. A bank's ledger also records balances, but the bank's role is to intermediate credit—to take deposits and make loans, transforming short-term liabilities into long-term assets. Blockchain networks do none of this. They simply maintain a record of who controls which tokens, with no credit creation, no maturity transformation, and no risk assessment.

Furthermore, the security model of blockchain—proof-of-work or proof-of-stake—is designed to ensure consensus on the state of the database, not to create economic value. The energy consumed or capital staked is a cost of maintaining the ledger, not an investment in productive activity. This is why Bitcoin's energy consumption is so controversial: it represents a massive expenditure of resources to maintain a database that processes a tiny fraction of global transactions. In a traditional financial system, the infrastructure costs are justified by the economic value created through lending and investment. In blockchain, the infrastructure costs are an end in themselves, with no corresponding productive output.

## 4. Triple-Entry Accounting Claims Misrepresent Distributed Systems

Proponents have often claimed that blockchain enables a revolutionary "triple-entry accounting" system. However, academic research has thoroughly debunked this claim. A 2024 paper by Schmidt and Vejzagić concludes that the term is misleading; blockchain does not create a new third entry but simply links the traditional double entries of two parties [12]. The immutability promise of blockchain is also undermined by the "oracle problem": the blockchain can only verify the authenticity of its own native tokens, not any external data entered onto it. If an operator enters incorrect information about a real-world event (e.g., the shipment of goods), the blockchain will faithfully and immutably record that incorrect information [13].

Leading accounting scholars have found the implementation of blockchain for financial reporting to be "infeasible" due to the existence of economic transactions outside the blockchain [14]. A comprehensive 2021 literature review confirmed that triple-entry accounting is not used in practice and is hampered by scalability and coordination problems [15]. While blockchain can improve the linking of records, it does not fundamentally change the principles of double-entry accounting [16]. The claim of a revolutionary new accounting paradigm is part of the verisimilitude—an appealing narrative that does not reflect reality.

The oracle problem is particularly damaging to the claim that blockchain can revolutionize accounting. For blockchain to serve as a universal ledger for economic activity, it must be able to verify the accuracy of data about real-world events—shipments, deliveries, services rendered, and so on. But blockchain can only verify the authenticity of its own native tokens. Any data entered from the outside world must be trusted, which reintroduces the very trust dependencies that blockchain was supposed to eliminate. This means that blockchain-based accounting systems are no more reliable than traditional systems when it comes to verifying the accuracy of external data. The immutability of the blockchain simply ensures that incorrect data, once entered, cannot be easily corrected—a feature that is more bug than benefit in the context of accounting, where errors must be correctable through standard amendment procedures.

Moreover, the coordination problem is insurmountable in practice. For triple-entry accounting to work, all parties to a transaction must agree to use the same blockchain and follow the same protocols. This requires a level of standardization and cooperation that has proven elusive even in traditional accounting, where decades of effort have produced only partial harmonization of standards across jurisdictions. The idea that businesses will voluntarily migrate to a shared blockchain ledger, exposing their transaction data to competitors and regulators in real-time, is unrealistic. The result is that blockchain accounting remains a theoretical concept with no practical implementation at scale.

## 5. Wash Trading Constitutes 25-95% of Reported Volume

The appearance of deep, liquid markets for cryptocurrencies is another key aspect of their verisimilitude. However, multiple academic studies have found that a staggering percentage of this volume is fabricated through wash trading. A 2023 study in *Management Science* analyzing over 448 million transactions found that **over 70% of reported volume on unregulated exchanges is wash trading**, amounting to trillions of dollars in fabricated volume annually [17]. A 2019 report submitted to the SEC by Bitwise concluded that **95% of reported Bitcoin trading volume was fake** [18]. Other studies have found similar levels of manipulation on decentralized exchanges [19] and in specific markets like prediction markets [20].

This pervasive manipulation means that the price discovery function of cryptocurrency markets is fundamentally broken. Prices are not the result of genuine supply and demand but are heavily influenced by artificial activity designed to create the illusion of liquidity and interest. The **CFTC's 2023 enforcement report**, which showed that nearly half of its actions involved digital assets, underscores the systemic nature of this problem [21].

The implications of this manipulation are profound. In traditional financial markets, price discovery is a critical function that allocates capital to its most productive uses. When prices reflect genuine supply and demand, they signal information about the value of assets and guide investment decisions. When prices are manipulated through wash trading, this signaling function breaks down. Investors are making decisions based on false information, and capital is misallocated. The fact that this manipulation is so pervasive in cryptocurrency markets—affecting not just a few bad actors but the majority of trading volume on many exchanges—suggests that the market structure itself is fundamentally flawed. This is not a problem that can be solved through better regulation or enforcement alone; it is a structural feature of a market that lacks the institutional safeguards and transparency requirements of traditional financial markets.

## 6. Bitcoin's Extraordinary Energy Consumption

The verisimilitude of a global financial system is maintained at an extraordinary environmental cost. The **Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance** estimates that Bitcoin's annual electricity consumption is comparable to that of entire countries like Austria or Norway [22]. A 2022 study in *Nature* calculated that the climate damages from Bitcoin mining are comparable to those of beef production or crude oil extraction, with every $1 in Bitcoin market value creating $0.35 in global climate damages [23]. Projections have shown that Bitcoin mining in China alone could have generated emissions exceeding those of the entire Czech Republic [24].

While proponents argue that this energy secures the network, the **IMF** has calculated that a single Bitcoin transaction consumes over a million times more energy than a VISA transaction [25]. Even when adjusting for batch processing, Bitcoin uses a disproportionate amount of global energy for a minuscule fraction of global transaction volume. The security itself is subsidized by block rewards, and as these rewards diminish, the network will require billions of dollars in transaction fees to maintain its security, a cost that would make it prohibitively expensive for most users [26]. The argument that this can be solved with renewable energy is also flawed, as even renewables have environmental costs and represent an opportunity cost—energy used for Bitcoin cannot be used to power homes or industries [27, 28].

## 7. Extreme Centralization Despite Decentralization Claims

The core narrative of blockchain is decentralization, but the empirical evidence reveals a system characterized by extreme centralization across every dimension.

-   **Mining:** The top 5 mining pools have consistently controlled 60-75% of Bitcoin's hashrate [29]. At times, a single pool has approached or exceeded the 51% threshold required for a theoretical attack [30].
-   **Wealth:** Bitcoin's Gini coefficient of 0.65 is comparable to the wealth inequality of a developed nation, with the top 0.01% of addresses controlling over 58% of all Bitcoin [31]. Other cryptocurrencies like Dogecoin are even more concentrated, with a single address holding over 23% of the supply [31].
-   **Exchanges:** The top 10 centralized exchanges control approximately 85% of all trading volume [32].
-   **DeFi and Governance:** In so-called "decentralized" finance (DeFi), 1% of token holders often control over 97% of the governance supply [33]. Development is dominated by a handful of core developers [34], and users actively seek out centralized trust anchors [35]. Even in proof-of-stake systems, a few large entities control the majority of validation power [36].

The **Bank for International Settlements (BIS)** aptly refers to this as the "decentralisation illusion" [37]. The reality is that blockchain networks are substantially centralized, concentrating power in the hands of a few miners, developers, and exchanges.

## 8. Greater Fool Theory Dynamics Dominate Valuation

Without contractual claims, cash flows, or productive utility, how are cryptocurrencies valued? The academic consensus is that their value is driven almost entirely by speculative sentiment, commonly known as the **Greater Fool Theory**. A 2015 study in *Economics Letters* found that the fundamental price of Bitcoin is zero and that its price is driven by a "substantial speculative component" [38]. Numerous studies have since confirmed the presence of recurring speculative bubbles across the cryptocurrency market [39, 40, 41, 42].

This is acknowledged even by industry bodies like the **CFA Institute**, which notes that cryptocurrencies "offer no cash flow underlying their valuations, their investment returns arise through capital gains alone"—the very definition of Greater Fool dynamics [43]. This is why prominent figures like Bill Gates and Warren Buffett have described the space as "100 percent based on greater fool theory" [44]. Without a tether to any underlying economic reality, the value of a cryptocurrency depends entirely on the ability to sell it to someone else for a higher price.

## 9. Conclusion: Verisimilitude vs. Reality

The evidence is overwhelming and consistent across multiple domains of academic and institutional research. Blockchain technology has not created a new financial system. It has created a verisimilitude—a convincing simulation that mimics the surface features of finance without its essential substance. It has ledgers, but no legally enforceable claims. It has trading, but it is dominated by artificial volume. It has a narrative of decentralization, but a reality of extreme centralization. It has a multi-trillion-dollar market capitalization, but no fundamental value.

This is not a critique of the technology itself, which may have valid applications in other domains. It is a critique of its misapplication as a foundation for a financial system. The future of digital finance will not be built on a simulation, no matter how convincing. It will be built on systems that embed the legal, contractual, and economic principles of actual finance into their architecture. The distinction between verisimilitude and reality is the critical insight required to move beyond the speculative era of cryptocurrency and toward a future of genuine, Balance-Sheet-Ready digital assets.

This paper focuses on the current state of blockchain technology as applied to cryptocurrency and financial assets. It does not evaluate potential future developments or alternative blockchain applications outside of finance. Future research should examine whether architectural modifications can address the fundamental issues identified here, or whether the limitations are inherent to the distributed ledger model itself.
