# The Real Cost of Digital Asset Platforms in 2025: Onli vs Traditional Development

## Executive Summary

**Bottom Line**: Building a complete digital asset exchange with traditional approaches costs **$1.67M - $3.24M over three years** with 12-18 month development cycles. Onli delivers the same capabilities for **$630K over three years** with 60-day deployment, representing **62-81% cost savings** and **83% faster time-to-market**.

The 2025 blockchain development landscape presents a stark choice: invest millions in traditional development with uncertain ROI timelines, or leverage Onli's infrastructure-as-a-service model that eliminates the complexity, reduces costs by over 60%, and delivers enterprise-grade capabilities in weeks rather than months.
