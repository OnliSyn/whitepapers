Why Our Design Choices Matter: A New
Paradigm for Digital Ownership
Author: Onli Business Team



1. Abstract

The digital age has ushered in an era of unprecedented creation and exchange of
digital assets, yet the legal and technical frameworks for owning these assets remain
fundamentally misaligned. This paper argues that the prevailing models of digital
asset ownership, including those based on blockchain technology and hierarchical file
systems, are inadequate because they fail to replicate the essential "bundle of rights"
that defines property in the physical world. Specifically, they lack the capacity for true
exclusion, possession, and uniqueness. This paper introduces the Onli paradigm, a
novel approach to digital ownership that leverages hyperdimensional vector storage
and tensor mathematics to create unitary, provably unique, and ownable digital
objects. By embedding identity, location, and credentials within the object itself, Onli
provides a new technical foundation for digital property that aligns with established
legal principles. This paper presents a comparative analysis of Onli against existing
frameworks, demonstrating its potential to unlock a new private data economy and
bridge the gap between technology and law.



2. Introduction

2.1. The Digital Ownership Dilemma

The proliferation of digital assets, from cryptocurrencies and non-fungible tokens
(NFTs) to personal data and AI models, has created a digital economy of immense
value. However, the very nature of digital information—its inherent replicability and
lack of physical form—has created a profound dilemma for ownership. As one popular
internet refrain puts it, "If buying isn't owning, then piracy isn't stealing" [2]. This
statement, while simplistic, captures the essence of the problem: our intuitive
understanding of ownership, forged over centuries of dealing with tangible property,
does not readily translate to the digital realm. The legal and technical systems we have
built to manage digital assets have, for the most part, failed to bridge this gap, leading
to a crisis of confidence and a fundamental misalignment between our expectations of
ownership and the reality of digital control.


2.2. Problem Statement

The core of the digital ownership problem lies in a fundamental conflict between the
design of existing digital asset systems and the foundational principles of property
law. Blockchain technology, often touted as the solution to digital ownership, secures
statements about information (records) but not the possession of things themselves
[13]. A private key, for example, demonstrates the power to sign a transaction, but it
does not confer a legal right to exclude others from holding perfect copies of the
underlying asset. Similarly, hierarchical file systems, the bedrock of modern
computing, were engineered for replication and availability, not singularity [19]. The
ability to create bit-perfect copies is a feature, not a bug, making it impossible to
establish true scarcity and uniqueness. This inherent replicability undermines the very
concept of exclusion, a cornerstone of the "bundle of rights" that defines property
ownership [7].


2.3. Thesis

This paper argues that a new technical paradigm is needed to solve the digital
ownership dilemma. We introduce the Onli system, a hyperdimensional vector storage
system that makes digital objects unitary, provably unique, and ownable. Onli replaces
the traditional "files in trees" model with unitary containers, called Genomes,
embedded in a tensor space. In this model, the object's identity, location, and
credentials (Genes) are not external metadata but are intrinsically part of the object
itself. This design choice allows for the creation of digital objects that are, by their very
nature, singular and excludable. By aligning the technical architecture of digital
objects with the legal principles of property law, Onli provides a new foundation for a
true digital ownership economy.


2.4. Structure of the Paper

This paper is structured as follows: Section 3 provides a literature review of property
law, blockchain technology, hierarchical file systems, and the accounting of digital
assets. Section 4 introduces the Onli paradigm, detailing its core concepts and
technical architecture. Section 5 presents a comparative analysis of Onli against
existing frameworks, using the four tests of ownership: exclusion, possession,
uniqueness, and provenance. Section 6 discusses the implications of the Onli
paradigm, including the potential for a new private data economy and the bridging of
the gap between technology and law. Finally, Section 7 offers a concluding summary
of our findings and a reflection on the importance of design choices in shaping the
future of digital ownership.



3. Literature Review

3.1. The Evolution of Property Law: From Tangible Assets to the
Digital Frontier

The concept of property has been a cornerstone of legal systems for centuries,
evolving from a simple understanding of ownership over tangible goods to a complex
web of rights and obligations in the modern era. The Roman law concept of dominium
established a foundation for absolute ownership, but it was the English common law
that developed the more nuanced "bundle of rights" theory, which has become the
dominant paradigm for understanding property ownership in many legal systems [7].
This theory posits that ownership is not a single, monolithic right but a collection of
distinct and separable rights, including the rights of possession, control, exclusion,
enjoyment, and disposition. The right of exclusion, in particular, has been identified as
a critical component of this bundle, as it is the right that allows an owner to prevent
others from using or benefiting from their property [9].

However, the digital age has presented a profound challenge to these traditional
notions of property. The intangible and infinitely replicable nature of digital assets has
made it difficult to apply the established principles of property law. As Jakub Wyczik
notes, "the classical view of property rights as relating to material objects is no longer
justified" [2]. The legal scholarship has been grappling with this challenge for over a
decade, with debates ranging from whether digital assets can be considered
"property" at all to how the various rights in the bundle can be applied in a digital
context [1]. The lack of a clear legal framework has led to a situation where ownership
of digital assets is often governed by a patchwork of contract law, intellectual property
law, and terms of service agreements, which can be confusing and often unfavorable
to the consumer [4].
3.2. The "Bundle of Rights" Theory in the Digital Context




The "bundle of rights" theory provides a useful framework for analyzing the
shortcomings of existing digital asset systems. The five core rights in the bundle are:

     The Right of Possession (ius possidendi): The right to have physical control
     over the property. In the digital realm, this right is complicated by the fact that
     digital assets are not physical and can be held by multiple parties
     simultaneously.

     The Right of Control: The right to determine how the property is used. This right
     is often limited in the digital world by DRM technologies and restrictive licensing
     agreements.

     The Right of Exclusion (ius prohibendi): The right to prevent others from using
     the property. This is perhaps the most difficult right to enforce in the digital
     realm, given the ease with which digital assets can be copied and distributed.

     The Right of Enjoyment (ius utendi fruendi): The right to use and benefit from
     the property. This right can be undermined by the lack of true ownership and
     control.
     The Right of Disposition (ius disponendi): The right to transfer the property to
     others. While digital assets can be transferred, the lack of a clear title and the risk
     of double-spending can make these transfers insecure.

The failure of existing digital asset systems to adequately address these rights has led
to a situation where true ownership is often illusory. As we will see in the following
sections, both blockchain technology and hierarchical file systems have fundamental
design flaws that prevent them from providing a robust foundation for digital property
rights-based digital ownership.


3.3. Blockchain and Digital Assets: A Critical Review

Blockchain technology has been widely hailed as a revolutionary solution for creating
and managing digital assets. Its decentralized and immutable ledger system offers a
way to record transactions in a secure and transparent manner. However, a closer
examination of the technology reveals that it has significant limitations when it comes
to establishing true ownership of digital assets. As Primavera De Filippi argues,
blockchain technology is "alegal" in the sense that it operates outside of traditional
legal frameworks [13]. While this may be seen as a feature by some, it creates
significant challenges for enforcing property rights.

The fundamental problem with blockchain-based ownership is that it secures records
of transactions, not the assets themselves. A token on a blockchain is essentially a
digital signature that represents a claim to an asset, but it does not confer the same
rights as physical possession. As Aaron Perzanowski has pointed out, the shift to
blockchain-based ownership has in many ways undermined digital ownership by
replacing the direct control of a file on a hard drive with a more abstract and less
secure form of ownership [4]. The recent wave of NFT thefts and scams has highlighted
the vulnerability of this model, as users have discovered that their expensive digital
"assets" can be easily stolen with no legal recourse.

Furthermore, the anonymity of many blockchain systems makes it difficult to identify
the parties involved in a transaction, which can be a major obstacle to resolving
disputes. The lack of a central authority also means that there is no one to turn to if
something goes wrong. While some have argued that "code is law" in the world of
blockchain, this is a poor substitute for a robust legal system that can protect the
rights of property owners [5].
3.4. Hierarchical File Systems: A Legacy of Replication

The hierarchical file system (HFS) has been the dominant paradigm for organizing and
storing data on computers for decades [19]. While it has served us well in many ways,
its fundamental design is based on the principle of replication, which is antithetical to
the concept of ownership. In an HFS, a file is simply a collection of bits that can be
easily copied and moved from one location to another. This makes it impossible to
create a truly unique and singular digital object. As the saying goes, "to be is to be a
copy."

The limitations of HFS for digital ownership are clear. The lack of singularity means
that it is impossible to enforce the right of exclusion, as perfect copies of a file can be
made with ease. The lack of a clear title also makes it difficult to establish who the true
owner of a file is. While metadata can be used to track ownership information, this is
an external and often unreliable solution. The recent development of scalable
metadata systems has attempted to address some of these limitations, but they do not
change the fundamental fact that HFS is a replication-based system [20].


3.5. Accounting and Auditing of Digital Assets: A Crisis of Assertions

The challenges of digital ownership are not limited to the legal and technical realms.
The accounting and auditing professions have also been struggling to adapt to the rise
of   digital   assets.   The   traditional   financial   statement   assertions—existence,
completeness, rights and obligations, and valuation—are difficult to apply to assets
that are intangible, decentralized, and often have no intrinsic value [11].

The assertion of existence, for example, is difficult to prove for a digital asset that does
not have a physical form. The assertion of rights and obligations is complicated by the
lack of a clear legal framework for digital ownership. And the assertion of valuation is a
major challenge for assets that are subject to extreme price volatility and have no
underlying fundamentals.

The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) has been slow to issue guidance on
the accounting of digital assets, leaving companies and auditors in a state of
uncertainty [10]. The American Institute of CPAs (AICPA) has published a practice aid
on the topic, but it is nonauthoritative and does not provide clear answers to many of
the most pressing questions [12]. This lack of clarity has created a crisis of assertions,
as auditors are unable to provide reasonable assurance that the financial statements
of companies holding digital assets are free from material misstatement.
4. The Onli Paradigm: A New Model for Digital
Ownership

4.1. From Files to Genomes: A New Object Model




The Onli system introduces a new object model that is designed to overcome the
limitations of traditional file systems and blockchain-based ledgers. Instead of treating
digital objects as files in a hierarchical tree, Onli treats them as unitary containers
called "Genomes." Each Genome is a self-contained object that carries its own history,
provenance, and policy. This is a fundamental departure from the traditional model,
where metadata is stored separately from the data itself.

The Genome is composed of three key elements:

     The Content: The actual data of the object, which can be anything from a
     document or an image to a complex AI model.

     The Metadata: Information about the object, such as its creation date, author,
     and ownership history.
         The Policy: A set of rules that govern how the object can be used, transferred,
         and modified.

By combining these three elements into a single, self-contained object, Onli creates a
new type of digital asset that is both more secure and more flexible than traditional
files.


4.2. The Power of Tensors: A Mathematical Foundation for Uniqueness

The key to Onli's ability to create provably unique digital objects lies in its use of tensor
mathematics and hyperdimensional vector storage. A tensor is a mathematical object
that describes a multilinear relationship between sets of algebraic objects associated
with a vector space [18]. In the Onli system, each Genome is assigned a unique
coordinate in a high-dimensional tensor space. This coordinate is not just a random
address; it is part of the object's mathematical identity.

This approach is inspired by the principles of hyperdimensional computing (HDC), a
field of computer science that uses high-dimensional vectors to represent and
manipulate information [16]. HDC has been shown to be a powerful tool for a variety of
tasks, including image recognition, natural language processing, and reasoning. The
Onli system applies the principles of HDC to the problem of digital ownership, using
high-dimensional vectors to create a new type of digital object that is both unique and
secure.


4.3. The Genome as a Unitary Container: Identity, Location, and
Credential

In the Onli system, the identity, location, and credentials of a digital object are not
separate entities; they are all part of the Genome itself. This is what makes the
Genome a truly unitary container. The Genome's coordinate in the tensor space
defines its identity, its location in a "Vault" defines its possession, and its associated
"Gene" defines its credentials.

This is a radical departure from the traditional model, where a file's identity is
determined by its name and its location in a file system. In the Onli system, a
Genome's identity is intrinsic to the object itself. This means that two Genomes cannot
have the same identity, even if they have the same content. This is what makes Onli's
digital objects provably unique.
4.4. The Gene as a Binding Credential: Secure and Verifiable Transfers

The "Gene" is the credential that authorizes the movement of a Genome from one
Vault to another. The Gene is a cryptographic key that is bound to the Genome's
identity. This means that only the holder of the Gene can authorize the transfer of the
Genome. This provides a high level of security and prevents unauthorized access to
digital assets.

The transfer process in the Onli system is designed to be both secure and verifiable.
When a Genome is transferred, it is not copied; it is moved from one Vault to another.
This ensures that there is only one copy of the Genome in existence at any given time.
The transfer is also recorded on a distributed ledger, which provides a tamper-evident
audit trail of all transactions.


4.5. The Vault as a Possession Locus: A Concrete Predicate for
Ownership

The "Vault" is the location where a Genome is stored. The Vault can be a physical
device, such as a hard drive, or a cloud-based storage service. The key is that the Vault
provides a concrete locus of possession. The statement "Genome X is in Vault Y" is a
crisp and verifiable predicate for ownership.

This is in stark contrast to the traditional model, where possession is a much more
ambiguous concept. In a hierarchical file system, for example, a file can be in multiple
locations at once. In a blockchain-based system, a token can be held by multiple
parties. The Onli system's concept of the Vault provides a much clearer and more
legally sound basis for establishing ownership.
5. Comparative Analysis: Onli vs. Existing Frameworks

5.1. The Four Tests of Ownership: A Comparative Analysis




To evaluate the effectiveness of different digital ownership systems, we can use a set of
four tests that are based on the core principles of property law:

     The Exclusion Test: Can non-owners be technically prevented from holding
     perfect substitutes?

     The Possession Test: Is there a concrete, observable fact of "who has it"?

     The Uniqueness Test: Can the system prove there is only one such object?

     The Provenance Test: Is history integral and tamper-evident at the object level?
 Test          Blockchain              Hierarchical File System      Onli

               No (records ≠
 Exclusion                             No (replication by design)    Yes (unitary objects)
               objects)

                                                                     Yes (Genome in
 Possession    No (key ≠ possession)   No (multiple copies)
                                                                     Vault)

                                       No (indistinguishable
 Uniqueness    No (token ≠ content)                                  Yes (intrinsic identity)
                                       copies)

 Provenance    Yes (ledger history)    No (external metadata)        Yes (history in object)


As the table above shows, both blockchain and hierarchical file systems fail to meet
the four tests of ownership. Blockchain fails on the exclusion and possession tests
because it secures records, not objects. HFS fails on all four tests because it is a
replication-based system. The Onli system, on the other hand, passes all four tests
because it is designed from the ground up to create unitary, provably unique, and
ownable digital objects.


5.2. Onli vs. Hierarchical File Systems: Overcoming the Legacy of
Replication

The fundamental difference between Onli and HFS is that Onli is a singularity-based
system, while HFS is a replication-based system. This has profound implications for
digital ownership. In an HFS, the only way to create a unique object is to rely on
external metadata, such as a file name or a database entry. This is a fragile and
unreliable solution, as the metadata can be easily changed or corrupted.

In the Onli system, uniqueness is an intrinsic property of the object itself. The
Genome's coordinate in the tensor space is a mathematical guarantee of its
singularity. This means that it is impossible to create two Genomes with the same
identity, even if they have the same content. This is a major breakthrough for digital
ownership, as it provides a way to create truly unique and scarce digital assets.


5.3. Onli vs. Traditional Ledgers: A New Object Model for Ownership

Traditional ledgers, including blockchain-based ledgers, are designed to record
transactions. They are not designed to create and manage ownable digital objects. A
token on a blockchain is simply a record of a transaction; it is not the asset itself. This
is a major limitation of the blockchain model, as it means that the asset is always
separate from the record of its ownership.

The Onli system, on the other hand, combines the asset and the record of its
ownership into a single, self-contained object. The Genome is both the asset and the
record of its ownership. This is a much more elegant and secure solution, as it
eliminates the need for a separate ledger. The Onli system's object model is a new
paradigm for digital ownership that has the potential to revolutionize the way we think
about and manage digital assets.



6. Implications and Future Work

6.1. The Emergence of a Private Data Economy

The Onli paradigm has the potential to unlock a new private data economy. By making
digital objects truly ownable, Onli creates a new class of assets that can be bought,
sold, and traded in a secure and transparent manner. This could have a major impact
on a wide range of industries, from finance and healthcare to media and
entertainment.

In the financial industry, for example, Onli could be used to create new types of digital
assets, such as tokenized securities and smart contracts. In the healthcare industry,
Onli could be used to give patients control over their own medical records. And in the
media and entertainment industry, Onli could be used to create new business models
for artists and creators.


6.2. New Capabilities and Markets: A New Frontier for Innovation

The Onli system also opens up a new frontier for innovation. By providing a robust
foundation for digital ownership, Onli makes it possible to create new types of
applications and services that are not possible with existing technologies. For
example, Onli could be used to create:

     Decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) that are more secure and
     transparent than existing DAOs.

     New types of social media platforms that give users control over their own
     data.
      New types of online marketplaces that are more fair and efficient than existing
      marketplaces.


6.3. The Philosophical and Legal Bridge: Aligning Technology with
Law

The Onli system is not just a technical innovation; it is also a philosophical and legal
one. By aligning the technical architecture of digital objects with the legal principles of
property law, Onli provides a bridge between the worlds of technology and law. This
could have a major impact on the way we think about and regulate digital assets.

In the long run, the Onli system could help to create a more just and equitable digital
world. By giving individuals control over their own data, Onli could help to level the
playing field between individuals and large corporations. And by providing a more
secure and transparent foundation for digital ownership, Onli could help to reduce the
risk of fraud and abuse.


6.4. Future Research Directions

The Onli system is still in its early stages of development, and there are many areas for
future research. Some of the most promising areas include:

      The development of new applications and services that are based on the Onli
      paradigm.

      The exploration of the legal and regulatory implications of the Onli system.

      The development of new tools and techniques for managing and analyzing
      Onli-based data.

We believe that the Onli system has the potential to revolutionize the way we think
about and manage digital assets. We are excited to see what the future holds for this
new and innovative technology.
7. Conclusion

7.1. Summary of Findings

This paper has argued that the prevailing models of digital asset ownership are
inadequate because they fail to replicate the essential "bundle of rights" that defines
property in the physical world. We have shown that both blockchain technology and
hierarchical file systems have fundamental design flaws that prevent them from
providing a robust foundation for digital property rights. We have also introduced the
Onli paradigm, a novel approach to digital ownership that leverages hyperdimensional
vector storage and tensor mathematics to create unitary, provably unique, and
ownable digital objects.


7.2. The Importance of Design Choices

The key takeaway from this paper is that design choices matter. The way we design our
digital systems has a profound impact on the way we interact with and own digital
assets. The Onli system is a testament to the power of good design. By aligning the
technical architecture of digital objects with the legal principles of property law, Onli
provides a new foundation for a true digital ownership economy. We believe that this
is a major step forward for the digital world, and we are excited to see what the future
holds for this new and innovative technology.
