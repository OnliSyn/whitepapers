-   **Abstract:** This report estimates the size of the markets that ONLI 3.0 hopes to serve. It divides the opportunity into four segments—stablecoins, crypto infrastructure, tokenized real‑world assets (RWAs) and over‑the‑counter derivatives—and provides current size and 2030 projections for each[github.com](https://github.com/OnliSyn/whitepapers/blob/main/onli-market-opportunity-validation-stablecoins-crypto-infra-rwas-otc-derivatives.md#:~:text=,AI%20infrastructure%2C%20and%20blockchain%20platforms). The paper accounts for overlaps (e.g., stablecoins backed by tokenized Treasury bills) to avoid double‑counting and concludes that these segments collectively represent a **total addressable market (TAM) of roughly US$17 trillion by 2030**, with ONLI targeting about **4 %** of this flow[github.com](https://github.com/OnliSyn/whitepapers/blob/main/onli-market-opportunity-validation-stablecoins-crypto-infra-rwas-otc-derivatives.md#:~:text=,AI%20infrastructure%2C%20and%20blockchain%20platforms). It argues that ONLI’s platform, with its flat US$0.05 minting fee and regulatory‑ready design, is well positioned for institutional issuers and traders[github.com](https://github.com/OnliSyn/whitepapers/blob/main/onli-market-opportunity-validation-stablecoins-crypto-infra-rwas-otc-derivatives.md#:~:text=,ONLI%27s%20infrastructure%20could%20thus).

Independent data confirm that stablecoin market cap reached **US$251.7 billion** when the U.S. Senate passed the GENIUS Act in June 2025[reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/stablecoins-market-cap-surges-record-high-us-senate-passes-bill-2025-06-18/#:~:text=June%2018%20%28Reuters%29%20,corner%20of%20the%20crypto%20market). Transaction volumes already exceed those of Visa and Mastercard; stablecoin transfers totalled **US$27.6 trillion in 2024**, surpassing the payment networks’ combined volume[cointelegraph.com](https://cointelegraph.com/news/stablecoins-beat-visa-mastercard-2024-volume#:~:text=The%20annual%20stablecoin%20transfer%20volume,io).

### **ONLI 3.0 Market Opportunity Validation**

**Executive Summary**

This report validates the market opportunity for the ONLI 3.0 platform across four key segments: Stablecoins, Cryptocurrency Infrastructure, Tokenized Real-World Assets (RWAs), and OTC Derivatives. Based on current market data and reputable third-party projections, we confirm a defensible converged **Total Addressable Market (TAM) of approximately $17.4 trillion by 2030**. The ONLI 3.0 platform is well-positioned to serve this market with its compelling value proposition of a flat, predictable, and low-cost issuance model, coupled with a strong focus on regulatory compliance. While capturing a **4% market share (≈$694 billion in annual flows)** is an ambitious target, it is plausible when benchmarked against the growth trajectories of other transformative fintech and blockchain platforms. The sheer scale of the opportunity means that even a fraction of the target capture would represent a massive business.

---

### **Stablecoins**

**Current Market Size**

Stablecoins—cryptocurrencies pegged to fiat currencies or assets—have become a significant part of the digital asset ecosystem. As of mid-2025, the total stablecoin market capitalization is in the mid-$200 billion range (approximately **$247 billion as of June 2025**).¹ Major U.S. dollar stablecoins like USDT and USDC are largely backed by cash and short-term U.S. Treasury bills. In fact, just two issuers, Tether and Circle, together hold about **$166 billion in U.S. Treasuries** as reserves.²

Stablecoins are heavily used in crypto trading and DeFi today, with transaction volumes exploding to **$26–27 trillion in 2024**, surpassing the annual throughput of Visa and Mastercard combined.³,⁴ This underscores the massive flow already facilitated by stablecoins. However, mainstream payments adoption remains nascent (only ~6% of stablecoin demand is for payments outside of crypto trading as of 2025),⁵ which suggests substantial room for growth if regulatory clarity brings more traditional use cases online.

**2030 Projection**

Credible projections foresee stablecoin supply reaching the low trillions by 2030. For example, analysts at Citi (2023) project a base-case of **~$1.6 trillion globally by 2030** (and up to $3.7 trillion in a bullish scenario).⁶ Standard Chartered similarly estimated the stablecoin market could reach **~$2 trillion by 2028** if supportive U.S. legislation passes.¹ These forecasts assume that clear regulation (such as the U.S. GENIUS Act for stablecoin oversight)⁷ and greater institutional integration will legitimize stablecoins for payments, remittances, and treasury uses. This would represent roughly a tenfold increase from today’s level.

**Overlap with Other Segments**

Stablecoins overlap with RWA tokenization because their reserves often consist of real-world assets. A large portion of stablecoin backing is in tokenized cash equivalents like T-bills.² In effect, stablecoins are a digital wrapper on fiat or short-term debt. To avoid double-counting, we will treat stablecoins and RWAs as distinct segments in the TAM, as most RWA market size reports explicitly exclude stablecoins.⁸

**ONLI 3.0 Platform Fit**

ONLI 3.0's platform is highly suited for the stablecoin segment, especially for institutional issuers. Its value proposition of a flat **$0.05 fee per asset minted, with no percentage fees or gas costs** is very compelling for stablecoins, which operate on thin spreads.⁹ This low, predictable cost structure would allow banks or fintech firms to issue high volumes of stablecoins without prohibitive fees, unlike on Ethereum where fluctuating gas costs could make large issuances expensive.⁹ Moreover, ONLI is described as **"regulatory ready" and GENIUS Act-compliant**,¹¹ meaning it is designed to meet forthcoming regulations on reserve transparency and oversight. This compliance focus is critical for institutional adoption.

### **Cryptocurrency Infrastructure (Crypto Market)**

**Current Market Size**

The "crypto infrastructure" segment is broad, targeting the overall crypto asset market and related network infrastructure outside of stablecoins and RWAs. As of August 2025, the total global cryptocurrency market is in the mid-single-digit trillions of dollars, ending Q2 2025 around **$3.5 trillion in total market cap**.¹² This includes major layer-1 blockchains (Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc.) and decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols.

**2030 Projection**

Forecasts for the crypto market’s growth vary widely, but a moderate aggregated forecast projects the total crypto market cap to approach **~$8 trillion by 2030**.¹⁴,¹⁵ This scenario assumes continued institutional buy-in, technical maturation, and regulatory clarity. However, a substantial portion of this 2030 value will likely come from tokenized versions of traditional assets, which will become part of the crypto market capitalization.¹⁴

**Overlap with Other Segments**

There is significant overlap between "crypto infrastructure" and the other segments. By definition, stablecoins and tokenized RWAs reside on crypto infrastructure and contribute to its market size. Adding a standalone "crypto market" TAM on top of stablecoins and RWAs would double-count those tokenized assets. To avoid this, we focus on the portion of the crypto market not already counted in stablecoin or RWA categories—such as native cryptocurrencies and DeFi tokens—which is still a large subset (multiple trillions).

**ONLI 3.0 Platform Fit**

ONLI 3.0 is a blockchain platform for asset issuance, making it part of the crypto infrastructure itself. Its design (developer-centric, low transaction costs) positions it to attract projects that would otherwise build on general-purpose chains. Its **$0.05 minting fee** model allows for issuing millions of tokens far more cheaply than on Ethereum.⁹ Additionally, ONLI’s emphasis on compliance could draw institutional players into crypto infrastructure by providing an enterprise-friendly, cost-predictable backbone for new services that require institutional-grade features.

---

### **Tokenized Real-World Assets (RWAs)**

**Current Market Size**

Tokenized real-world assets—the conversion of traditional assets into blockchain-based tokens—have begun to gain serious momentum. As of early 2025, the total on-chain RWA value exceeded **$50 billion** (excluding stablecoins).⁸ This includes tokenized U.S. Treasury bonds, real estate tokens, and other security tokens. By some estimates, RWA tokenization could reach **$500 billion by the end of 2025**.⁸

**2030 Projection**

Numerous financial institutions and consultancies agree that the opportunity by 2030 is in the trillions. Boston Consulting Group (2022) predicted up to **$16.1 trillion** of illiquid assets could be tokenized by 2030.¹⁷,¹⁸ A 2025 Mordor Intelligence report projects the asset tokenization market to grow to **$13.55 trillion by 2030**.¹⁹,²⁰ These figures cover a broad spectrum of tokenized assets, including equities, bonds, real estate, and investment funds. Citigroup's "Future of Money" report likewise estimated on the order of **$4–5 trillion** in tokenized securities by 2030 as a base case.²²

**Overlap with Other Segments**

RWAs overlap with other categories, most notably with stablecoins. However, most RWA estimates explicitly exclude fiat-pegged stablecoins to avoid confusion.⁸ The most significant overlap is with the crypto market itself, as tokenized RWAs will reside on crypto networks and contribute to the overall crypto market cap. Thus, we will count RWAs as the primary source of new digital asset value in our TAM calculation.

**ONLI 3.0 Platform Fit**

The tokenized RWA segment is arguably ONLI 3.0’s strongest fit, as the platform is purpose-built to enable the issuance of regulated assets. ONLI’s flat fee model (**$0.05 to mint an asset token**) is extremely attractive for high-value RWAs, drastically lowering the cost of bringing assets on-chain.⁹ Beyond cost, ONLI touts features that appeal to institutions, such as being **"transparent, developer-friendly, and regulatory-ready."**²⁶ This alignment with legal and compliance needs is crucial for winning mandates from tier-1 banks for tokenization projects.²⁷ ONLI's scalability and support for permissioned environments mean it can handle institutional volumes, positioning it as an ideal platform for RWA issuance. This segment is expected to drive **~78% of ONLI's targeted captured revenue**.²⁸

### **OTC Derivatives**

**Current Market Size**

The global OTC derivatives market is enormous in notional terms (**about $667 trillion**), but much smaller when measured by gross market value, which fluctuates in the teens of trillions. The gross market value of OTC derivatives was roughly **$18 trillion at the end of 2023**.³⁰ Today, this market primarily uses traditional financial infrastructure, with very little activity on blockchain platforms.

**2030 Projection**

A straightforward "2030 TAM" forecast for tokenized derivatives doesn't exist yet due to the nascent nature of this concept. ONLI’s deck uses a conservative **$12 trillion figure** for on-chain OTC derivatives TAM,³¹ assuming a portion of the current gross market value will shift to a digital format. Even a **5% penetration** of this market by 2030 could represent a multi-trillion dollar opportunity.

**Overlap with Other Segments**

There is potential overlap between OTC derivatives and RWAs. A tokenized derivative contract could be considered a form of RWA, but it is safer to treat them as distinct. For the purposes of TAM calculation, we will count tokenized underlying assets in the RWA segment and derivative contracts in the OTC segment to avoid double-counting.

**ONLI 3.0 Platform Fit**

ONLI's platform could revolutionize the OTC derivatives market by providing a tokenization and lifecycle management layer for contracts. The **ultra-low per-asset fee ($0.05)** means it could tokenize even large derivative contracts for pennies, streamlining a process that traditionally involves extensive legal paperwork and clearing fees. ONLI's **"regulatory ready"** features are crucial, as they would allow the platform to enforce compliance checks (e.g., KYC) required for institutional participants. Its cross-market span—covering stablecoins for collateral, RWAs for underlying assets, and derivatives—makes it a compelling one-stop platform for large financial players. 

---

### **Overlapping Segments and Adjusted TAM**

Summing the raw TAMs of all four segments would overstate the opportunity due to overlaps. We have addressed this by:

* **Stablecoins vs. Tokenized RWAs:** Treating the **$2 trillion stablecoin TAM** as distinct from the **$13.55 trillion RWA TAM**, as RWA forecasts typically exclude pure currency tokens.
* **Crypto Infrastructure vs. Stablecoins/RWAs:** Recognizing that the overall crypto market includes stablecoins and tokenized assets. ONLI’s approach avoids double-counting by treating RWAs and stablecoins as the core, and folding incremental crypto/derivative opportunity into the converged TAM.
* **RWAs vs. OTC Derivatives:** Counting underlying assets in the RWA TAM and contracts under the OTC segment to avoid overlap.

After these adjustments, ONLI's converged TAM is much lower than the simple sum of segments. The slide figures summed to ~$30T,³⁷ but ONLI estimated an adjusted total of **$17.36 trillion**.³⁸ This was arrived at by taking the largest segment (RWAs ~$13.55T) + stablecoins ($2T) + a small, unique portion of crypto/derivatives (~$1.8T). This is a conservative and defensible approach. We validate this methodology and find that a converged TAM on the order of **$15–20 trillion** is plausible by 2030.

---

### **Total TAM (~$17.36T) and 4% Capture Feasibility**

The more critical question is whether ONLI can realistically capture **4% of that TAM (~$694 billion in annual flows)**. This would equate to roughly $58 billion per month in assets issued or transacted via ONLI, a significant but not unimaginable volume.

**Benchmarks from Fintech and Crypto Platforms:**

* **Global Payment Networks:** Visa processed about **$14 trillion** in payments volume in 2022.⁴³ ONLI's target of ~$0.7T/year is only 5% of Visa’s current volume, showing a single network can handle multi-trillion-dollar annual flows.
* **Blockchain Networks:** The Ethereum network facilitated over **$11.6 trillion** in transaction volume in 2021, and stablecoin transfer volume was around **$26 trillion** in 2022.³ This proves a public blockchain can handle multi-trillion-dollar throughput. ONLI's target of ~$0.7T is only ~2.5% of stablecoins' 2024 volume, making it achievable if the platform becomes a dominant player.
* **Big Tech Platforms:** AWS essentially created the cloud computing market and now holds well over **30%** of it. If ONLI is akin to "AWS for asset tokenization," a single-digit percentage share globally is not outrageous.

**Risks and Realities:**

Capturing a 4% market share is a very high bar for a startup. ONLI will face competition from incumbent financial institutions and potentially slower-than-expected regulatory timelines. However, the sheer scale of the converged market means even a sliver is enormous. For instance, if ONLI captures just **1%**, that's still **$170 billion** in annual flows, which would be enough to generate tens of millions in revenue.

**Final Summary and Recommendation**

Our research validates ONLI 3.0’s claimed market opportunities in stablecoins, crypto infrastructure, tokenized RWAs, and OTC derivatives. The converged **$17.4 trillion TAM by 2030 is realistic** and supported by independent forecasts. ONLI 3.0’s platform appears well-aligned to serve institutional needs with its **cost-efficiency, scalability, and compliance features**.

The **4% capture target (~$694B)** is optimistic but plausible if ONLI becomes a leading platform. It will require the company to achieve widespread adoption among developers and institutions by leveraging its unique advantages. Given the benchmarks and the rapid growth of the tokenization space, we find ONLI’s goals to be aggressive yet attainable.

The recommendation is that ONLI continue to solidify partnerships and compliance credentials to become the trusted highway for digital assets. If it does so, the convergence of these four markets could indeed funnel a significant portion of value through ONLI’s ecosystem, realizing projected multi-billion dollar revenue streams.
