>
> **Stablecoins**
>
> **Current Market Size:** Stablecoins -- cryptocurrencies pegged to
> fiat currencies or assets -- have become a significant part of the
> digital asset ecosystem. As of mid-2025, the total stablecoin market
> capitalization is in 1
>
> the mid-\$200 billion range (approximately \$247 billion as of June

2

> **2030 Projection:** Credible projections foresee **stablecoin supply
> reaching the low trillions by 2030**. For example, analysts at Citi
> (2023) project a base-case of \~\$1.6 trillion globally by 2030 (and

> **Overlap with Other Segments:** Stablecoins overlap with **RWA

> Notably, a large portion of stablecoin backing is in tokenized **cash

> **ONLI 3.0 Platform Fit:** ONLI 3.0's platform is *highly suited* for
> the stablecoin segment, especially for institutional issuers. Its
> value proposition (a **flat \$0.05 fee per asset minted, with no

>
> **gas costs** ) is very compelling for stablecoins, which operate on

> Moreover, ONLI is described as *"regulatory ready"* and **GENIUS

> **Current Market Size:** The "crypto infrastructure" segment is

estimates the crypto market will grow at \~30% CAGR to reach **\$7.98T

transaction have averaged \~\$0.43 and can spike much higher) . This
cost advantage scales with volume: ONLI's flat fee *does not rise with
asset value or network congestion*, which is attractive for
high-throughput use 9

> fell \~13% in 2023 as 30

rates stabilized) . This gross market value represents the economic
exposure or risk value of derivatives contracts at current prices
(excluding the notional that nets out). The OTC derivatives universe
spans interest rate swaps (the largest chunk by far), FX forwards and
swaps, credit default swaps, and others -- primarily instruments used by
institutions for hedging and speculation outside of regulated exchanges.
Today, almost all of this trading and contract management happens via
traditional financial infrastructure (broker-dealer networks,
clearinghouses, ISDA contracts, etc.), with *very little occurring on
blockchain platforms* yet. However, the size of this market (even
*conservatively* \~\$12--18T in value, with **notional** 29

*points of many markets rather than dominate one* . That approach is
wise given the converging nature of finance and crypto.

As for capturing **4% of the \~\$17T TAM (\~\$694B)**: this is an
**ambitious target**, but our analysis finds it *plausible* if ONLI
becomes a leading platform. Historical analogues in fintech and tech
show top platforms can claim several percent of huge markets. To improve
the odds, **ONLI should focus on high-value sub segments first** -- for
example, becoming the default network for **tokenized bonds and funds (a
multi trillion opportunity) or for regulated stablecoin issuance**.
Success in one segment can create network effects and trust to expand
into others. Moreover, partnering with incumbent financial institutions
(who bring large asset volumes) could accelerate ONLI's share gain.

> In conclusion, **ONLI 3.0's \~\$17 trillion TAM by 2030 is supported
> by current market data and projections** (global finance is indeed
> moving on-chain), and capturing even a few percent of that would yield
> enormous flows. A \~4% share (\~\$694B) is **optimistic but not
