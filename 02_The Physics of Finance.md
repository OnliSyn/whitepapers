## Abstract

Despite achieving multi-trillion-dollar market capitalizations, cryptocurrencies fundamentally fail to qualify as true financial assets. This paper introduces the **Physics of Finance**, a first-principles framework positing that finance, like physics, is governed by immutable laws of accountability rather than arbitrary preference. We define the essential properties of an asset—specifically **Identifiable Ownership** (legal identity) and **Property Rights** (enforceable claims)—and demonstrate a fatal discrepancy between financial assets and cryptographic entries. We argue that cryptocurrencies, by their very design, violate these principles. They are the most prominent example of the **Ledger Fallacy**—the mistaken belief that a record of ownership constitutes ownership itself. Lacking an issuer, a corresponding liability, and the legal bundle of rights that defines property, cryptocurrencies exist as speculative intangible assets, not financial instruments. Through the "Judge's Dilemma" and the fundamental assertions of accounting, we prove that a cryptographic key conveys **possession** (access) but not **property** (rights). Consequently, treating cryptocurrency as a financial asset is an **Ontological Error**: mistaking a simulation (verisimilitude) for the reality it mimics. This paper deconstructs the legal and accounting shortcomings of ledger-based tokens and presents the ONLI architecture as the solution—a law-preserving system that enables the creation of digital assets that satisfy the Physics of Finance through actual possession and a clear issuer-liability model.

## 1. Introduction: The Premise of Immutable Laws

This paper is not an evaluative critique of the utility or popularity of cryptocurrency, but an ontological inquiry into its nature. We posit that Finance, like Physics, is governed by immutable laws of accountability rather than arbitrary preference. The discourse surrounding cryptocurrency has been dominated by narratives of technological disruption, market capitalization, and adoption rates. However, these are external attributes that do not alter an object's internal nature. Novelty, adoption, and market capitalization are irrelevant to the question of whether something *is* an asset.

All economic trust relies on the ability to verify the truth of an asset. This truth is established via the four **Accounting Assertions**: Existence, Completeness, Rights & Obligations, and Valuation. These assertions are not preferences; they are logical constraints. If an object cannot logically satisfy these assertions, it cannot be a financial asset, regardless of its market capitalization or popular adoption.

This paper will demonstrate that cryptocurrency, due to its very architecture, commits an **ontological error**: it is a simulation of an asset—a verisimilitude—that appears asset-like but lacks the essential properties required for economic trust and accountability.

## 2. The Physics of Accountability: Why Finance Has Laws, Not Preferences

Physics describes how the physical world works through laws that cannot be violated regardless of human preference or technological advancement. Similarly, finance is not an arbitrary collection of "agreed" conventions but a system built on fundamental requirements that emerge from the nature of economic trust itself.

The comparison is precise. Just as conservation of mass-energy means matter cannot be created or destroyed, the principle of accounting duality means every financial asset must have a corresponding liability on an identifiable issuer's balance sheet. Just as thermodynamics' second law means entropy always increases in closed systems, the requirement for identifiable ownership means anonymous assets cannot support economic accountability. These are not regulatory preferences or technological limitations—they are ontological necessities.

The International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), unchanged in principle since Luca Pacioli codified double-entry bookkeeping in 1494, reflect these fundamental laws [1]. When the IFRS Interpretations Committee ruled in June 2019 that cryptocurrency "is not a financial asset," they were not expressing opinion—they were recognizing that crypto violates the basic physics of finance [2]. The ruling stated that holdings of cryptocurrencies do not meet the definition of a financial asset under IAS 32 because they do not give rise to a contractual right to receive cash or another financial instrument.

The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) reached the same conclusion in ASU 2023-08, requiring cryptocurrency to be classified as "indefinite-lived intangible assets," not financial instruments [3]. The International Monetary Fund's 2019 guidance on the treatment of crypto assets in macroeconomic statistics similarly concluded that crypto assets "are not financial assets" because they lack a corresponding liability [4].

This is not a matter of regulatory conservatism or institutional resistance to innovation. It is a recognition that certain properties are constitutive of what an asset *is*.

## 3. The Two Fundamental Laws of Financial Assets

The foundational law of the Physics of Finance is that **an asset is property owned**. This requires two essential properties that an asset must possess:

### 3.1. First Law: There Must Be an Identifiable Owner

An asset requires ownership, not mere possession or control. Ownership is a legal status, not a physical state, and it cannot be anonymous. There must be proof of identity that connects a legal person (natural or juridical) to the property claimed. This is not a bureaucratic preference but a foundational necessity for accountability. **Anonymity negates accountability.** If there is no "Who," there is no recourse.

The Uniform Commercial Code Article 8, governing investment securities, requires that every security have an identifiable "entitlement holder" whose rights are enforceable in law [5]. Section 8-503 establishes that "property interest...is enforceable against the purchaser" only when specific identification requirements are met. Anonymous blockchain addresses fail this test categorically.

Banking regulation codifies this requirement. The Basel Committee's Guidelines for Counterparty Credit Risk Management mandate that banks identify and assess counterparties' material vulnerabilities through "accessing credit registers, evaluating legal status, considering the level of regulatory oversight" [6]. The Federal Reserve's SR 11-10 guidance emphasizes identifying the "qualitative factors such as strategy, quality of risk management practices, and staff composition" of counterparties [7]. These requirements presuppose knowing who the counterparty is.

Cryptocurrency's pseudonymous architecture—where ownership is reduced to possession of cryptographic keys linked to anonymous addresses—violates this fundamental law. A cryptographic key provides **control**, but not legally identifiable **ownership**. The blockchain shows addresses, not owners. When keys are lost or stolen, there is no legal owner to make a claim, no identity to verify rights, no person against whom remedies can be enforced. The blockchain may show that address "1A2B3C..." controls certain units, but this is possession without ownership—a fundamental category error.

#### The Judge's Dilemma

Consider a thought experiment: If five people hold the same private key, the blockchain cannot distinguish the owner. A judge adjudicating a dispute must look *outside* the code to find the "meeting of minds"—the legal agreement that establishes ownership. The blockchain provides no answer to the question "Who owns this?" It only answers "Who can move this?" This is the distinction between **control** and **ownership**, and it is not a technical limitation—it is an ontological distinction.

This is the **Ownership Test**, and cryptocurrency fails it.

### 3.2. Second Law: It Must Be Property (A Bundle of Legal Rights)

Property is not a feeling, preference, or technical capability—it is a **bundle of rights** defined by legislation and enforced through regulation. Possession of property is a distinct legal event that creates enforceable relations between persons with respect to things.

Wesley Hohfeld's 1913 framework, adopted by the American Law Institute's Restatement of Property, decomposed ownership into eight fundamental legal relations [8][9]:

1.  **Right**: A claim against others to non-interference (with a correlative duty in others).
2.  **Privilege**: Freedom to use (with a correlative no-right in others).
3.  **Power**: The ability to transfer or modify legal relations (with a correlative liability in others).
4.  **Immunity**: Freedom from others' power to extinguish one's rights (with a correlative disability in others).

Bitcoin holders possess none of these legal relations. They cannot sue for theft in most jurisdictions (no right with a correlative duty). They have no legal recourse if miners refuse transactions (no privilege enforceable against others). Their ability to transfer depends entirely on network consensus, not legal power. They have no immunity from protocol changes that could eliminate their holdings.

The Supreme Court in *International News Service v. Associated Press* (1918) established that property exists "only so far as it has been recognized and sanctioned by positive law, and the common usage of the State" [10]. Bitcoin exists outside this framework—it is recognized neither by positive law as property nor sanctioned by state enforcement mechanisms.

Holding Bitcoin provides **transferability**, but not a bundle of **legal rights**. A blockchain allows you to move a token (a function), but if the key is stolen, the protocol offers no right of recovery (no exclusion). Crypto offers possession, not property. A record, public or immutable, or in and of itself being able to be recorded without custodial validation, is not in and of itself proof of ownership, value, or rights.

This is the **Property Rights Test**, and cryptocurrency fails it.

## 4. The Accounting Assertions: Why These Laws Cannot Be Violated

Without passing the Ownership and Property Rights tests, the four accounting assertions that form the foundation of economic trust become impossible to satisfy:

### 4.1. Existence

The asset must actually exist as claimed. For financial assets, existence means more than technical presence—it means legal and economic reality. Blockchain entries exist as data, but without an identifiable owner and property rights, they do not exist as assets in any meaningful economic sense.

The Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) inspection observations from June 2023 found "deficiencies in testing the existence assertion related to crypto assets" precisely because auditors cannot verify existence using traditional confirmation procedures [11]. There is no counterparty to confirm obligations with, no legal entity to verify ownership against. We can verify that blockchain entries exist, but not that they represent actual economic assets with legal standing.

### 4.2. Completeness

All assets must be accounted for with no omissions. The estimated 20% of Bitcoin permanently lost due to forgotten keys represents approximately $200 billion that can never be accounted for—a black hole in the completeness assertion [12]. Traditional financial assets have recovery mechanisms through courts, trustees, and legal processes. Cryptocurrency's "code is law" philosophy makes completeness structurally impossible. Lost keys mean permanently unaccountable "assets."

### 4.3. Valuation and Allocation

Assets must be properly valued and allocated to rightful owners. Without property rights, what exactly is being valued? The market prices cryptocurrency based on speculative trading, but this is not valuation of property rights or future cash flows—it is pricing of entries in a distributed database. As the IMF's 2019 guidance states, without corresponding liabilities, these cannot be valued as financial assets [4].

### 4.4. Rights and Obligations

The holder must have enforceable rights, and the obligor must have enforceable obligations. IAS 32 paragraph 11 requires financial assets to represent "a contractual right to receive cash or another financial asset from another entity" [13]. The standard emphasizes "another entity"—there must be someone on the other side of the transaction who owes something.

Bitcoin has no obligor, no entity with obligations, no party who owes anything to holders. This is not a missing feature—it is marketed as the core innovation. But this "innovation" violates the fundamental physics of finance. As legal scholar Eric Chason observed: "A financial asset that does not have someone who is legally obliged to pay your money in the future is an extremely strange thing. An asset without being a liability, something whose base value is zero" [14].

There are no rights and obligations in the legal sense. No owner. No rights. No assertion can be depended on.

## 5. The Distinction: External vs. Internal Properties

The error of narrative is to define a thing by how it is *received* (popularity, price, adoption). The logic of physics defines a thing by its *properties* (mass, velocity). Adoption does not transmute nature. A simulation of gold, no matter how popular, does not gain the atomic weight of gold. Therefore, the popularity of Bitcoin is irrelevant to its ontological status as an asset.

This is a critical point: novelty, adoption, and market capitalization are external attributes. They do not alter an object's internal nature. The fact that millions of people trade cryptocurrency does not make it a financial asset any more than millions of people playing a video game makes the game currency legal tender.

## 6. The Verisimilitude: Simulation Without Substance

Cryptocurrency represents a verisimilitude—a simulation that resembles a financial asset but lacks its essential properties. Like a flight simulator that mimics aviation without achieving flight, cryptocurrency mimics financial assets without achieving economic substance.

The simulation is sophisticated. Blockchain creates artificial scarcity through cryptographic proof-of-work. It enables transfers through distributed consensus. It maintains immutable records through merkle trees. But none of this technology creates ownership or property rights—it merely simulates their effects.

Consider how actual financial assets work. A corporate bond represents a legal obligation by an identifiable issuer to pay specified amounts on specified dates. The bondholder has enforceable rights; the issuer has enforceable obligations. If the issuer defaults, bankruptcy law provides remedies. If bonds are stolen, courts can restore ownership. Every aspect is grounded in law, not code.

Cryptocurrency inverts this structure. Instead of law enforced by technology, it attempts technology enforced by nothing. When the DAO hack occurred in 2016, $50 million in Ether was stolen through code exploitation [15]. The response? A hard fork that split the blockchain—a deus ex machina intervention that revealed the absence of any legal framework. No courts adjudicated rights, no bankruptcy process allocated losses, no regulatory body enforced protections. The community simply rewrote history through consensus—the antithesis of property rights.

### The "What" Question

This is the **Ledger Fallacy**: the mistaken belief that a record of ownership constitutes ownership itself. A ledger is an immutable record. But a record of *what*? It records the movement of a string of code. It does not record the movement of "Rights" or "Obligations" because those do not exist in the code.

A key is proof of access, not ownership. It is a measure of control, not ownership. A ledger is meant to be a record of an event. A ledger entry is not just a record. The question must be: you are recording a record of "what?" It is the *what* that is the key component that requires distinction and classification, not the act of recording it.

## 7. Why Technology Cannot Break the Rules of Finance

The most sophisticated engineering cannot violate physical laws. No algorithm, however clever, can create perpetual motion machines. Similarly, no cryptographic protocol can create financial assets without satisfying their fundamental requirements.

The attempt to do so reflects a category error—confusing technical capabilities with legal realities. Blockchain solves the double-spending problem through distributed consensus, but this is a technical achievement about data consistency, not an economic achievement about asset creation. It is analogous to creating a detailed video game economy—the internal consistency may be perfect, but the game currency is not thereby transformed into legal tender.

Recent attempts to bridge this gap through "Controllable Electronic Records" in UCC Article 12 acknowledge the problem but do not solve it [16]. Section 12-104 defines control through exclusive power to transfer and prevent others from transferring, but this is still possession-based, not ownership-based. The Comments acknowledge that "control" under Article 12 "does not require that the person in control be the 'owner' of the controllable electronic record." This admission reveals the continued conflation of control with ownership.

The industry's failure lies in trying to force a system of **Absolute Possession** (Crypto) to function within a system of **Relational Rights** (Finance). This is the ontological error.

## 8. Corporate Treasury and Institutional Reality

The institutional verdict is unanimous. Apple Inc., with $156 billion in cash and marketable securities, holds zero cryptocurrency. Microsoft, Google, Berkshire Hathaway—none treat crypto as a treasury asset. JPMorgan Chase's 2025 10-Q filing explicitly states: "We do not currently hold cryptocurrencies for our own account as principal positions" [17].

These institutions are not technologically naïve—they operate some of the world's most sophisticated IT infrastructure. They reject cryptocurrency not from ignorance but from understanding. Their treasury policies require assets that satisfy fiduciary duties, meet regulatory capital requirements, and support financial statement assertions. Cryptocurrency satisfies none of these requirements because it violates the fundamental laws of financial assets.

When MicroStrategy holds Bitcoin on its balance sheet, it must classify it as an "indefinite-lived intangible asset" under ASU 2023-08, not as cash, cash equivalents, or financial instruments [18]. The accounting treatment reveals the reality: Bitcoin is more akin to a trademark or brand—an intangible construct that may have market value but lacks the fundamental properties of financial assets.

Only 79 publicly traded companies hold Bitcoin on their balance sheets as of 2025, representing less than 0.2% of the approximately 40,000 publicly traded companies globally. This is not a sign of early adoption—it is a sign of fundamental incompatibility with institutional finance.

## 9. The Superior Architecture: Possession WITH Ownership

The solution is not to abandon digital innovation but to respect financial physics while embracing technological advancement. Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) like Intel SGX demonstrate how to combine possession-based control with identifiable ownership and enforceable rights [19].

In a TEE-based system:

-   **Ownership is preserved**: Legal entities issue and stand behind digital assets.
-   **Property rights are enforceable**: Courts can compel TEE operators to honor legal judgments.
-   **Accounting assertions are verifiable**: Auditors can confirm existence, completeness, valuation, and rights.
-   **Recovery is possible**: Lost keys do not mean permanent loss—legal processes can restore rightful ownership.

This architecture respects both technological innovation and financial law. It uses cryptography for security and efficiency while maintaining the issuer-liability relationships that make assets economically real.

The Onli Protocol implements this architecture through three core components:

1.  **Genomes**: Digital assets that are unique, self-contained, and identity-based objects, not ledger entries.
2.  **Genes**: Cryptographic credentials bound to KYC-verified legal identities, ensuring identifiable ownership.
3.  **Use Policies**: Declarative, non-Turing-complete rules that define an enforceable bundle of rights, not complex smart contracts.

By satisfying the two fundamental laws—identifiable ownership and property rights—Onli assets can meet the four accounting assertions, making them suitable for institutional adoption as **Balance-Sheet-Ready** digital assets [20].

## 10. The Ontological Clarity

The error of cryptocurrency is not technological but ontological—a fundamental misunderstanding of what financial assets are. By attempting to create assets without owners and property without rights, cryptocurrency commits a category error equivalent to attempting to create matter without mass or energy without the capacity to do work.

Finance, like physics, operates according to laws that emerge from the nature of reality itself. The requirement for identifiable ownership is not arbitrary bureaucracy—it is necessary for accountability. The requirement for property rights is not regulatory preference—it is necessary for economic coordination. The requirement for issuer obligations is not institutional conservatism—it is necessary for value to exist beyond mere speculation.

## 11. Conclusion: The Immutable Requirements

No technology, however sophisticated, can break the rules of finance any more than engineering can violate conservation laws. The two fundamental requirements—identifiable ownership and property rights—are not obstacles to be overcome but foundational principles that make economic trust possible.

Cryptocurrency will never cross the chasm to institutional adoption because it commits an ontological error. It is a verisimilitude—a simulation that appears asset-like but fails the fundamental tests required for economic trust. The future of digital finance belongs to law-preserving systems that respect the immutable requirements of the Physics of Finance.

### A.6. Methodology Notes

This paper uses a first-principles, deductive approach. It establishes the fundamental properties of a financial asset based on established legal and accounting principles and then evaluates cryptocurrency against those properties. The argument is structured as a logical sequence: (1) Define the laws of finance, (2) Define the properties of an asset, (3) Test cryptocurrency against those properties, (4) Conclude that cryptocurrency fails the tests.

### A.7. Limitations and Future Research

This paper focuses on the ontological nature of cryptocurrency and does not evaluate its utility as a speculative instrument, a medium of exchange in niche contexts, or a store of value for individuals willing to accept its risks. Future research could explore the application of the Physics of Finance framework to other forms of digital assets, including stablecoins, central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), and tokenized securities.
