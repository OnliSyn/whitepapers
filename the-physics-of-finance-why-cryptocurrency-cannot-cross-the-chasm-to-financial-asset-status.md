    -   **Legal analysis:** Ownership in law is defined by a set of rights: possession, control, exclusion, enjoyment and disposition[github.com](https://github.com/OnliSyn/whitepapers/blob/main/the-physics-of-finance-why-cryptocurrency-cannot-cross-the-chasm-to-financial-asset-status.md#:~:text=1,Ownership). Court cases and legal scholarship emphasize that mere possession is insufficient; ownership requires enforceable rights recognized by a legal system[github.com](https://github.com/OnliSyn/whitepapers/blob/main/the-physics-of-finance-why-cryptocurrency-cannot-cross-the-chasm-to-financial-asset-status.md#:~:text=1,Ownership).
        
    -   **Cryptocurrency vs. financial assets:** Cryptocurrencies do not confer a legally enforceable claim to underlying value. Holders of a private key can transfer tokens but cannot exclude others from owning exact copies or control the underlying code; thus they lack key rights in the bundle of ownership[github.com](https://github.com/OnliSyn/whitepapers/blob/main/the-physics-of-finance-why-cryptocurrency-cannot-cross-the-chasm-to-financial-asset-status.md#:~:text=1,Ownership).

    -   **Forward‑looking view:** Regulatory frameworks like the GENIUS Act may eventually create stablecoins that are backed by legal claims (e.g., tokenized deposits or CBDCs), potentially blurring the line between crypto and financial assets.

### **The Physics of Finance: Why Cryptocurrency Cannot Cross the Chasm to Financial Asset Status**

**Author:** Dhryl Anton

**Abstract**
This whitepaper examines the fundamental legal, accounting, and financial reasons why cryptocurrency, despite its growing market capitalization and transactional utility, cannot be classified as a true financial asset. Through an in-depth analysis of property rights, asset classification standards, regulatory frameworks, and legal precedents, this paper argues that cryptocurrency lacks the foundational legal ownership structure and contractual rights that are the hallmarks of traditional financial assets. The paper concludes that cryptocurrency is more accurately classified as a speculative, intangible asset with a distinct and limited set of property rights, and that this distinction has profound implications for investors, regulators, and the future of finance.

### **1. The Legal Foundations of Asset Ownership: A Framework for Analysis**

The concept of a "financial asset" is fundamentally rooted in the legal principles of ownership and property rights. Before an item can be considered a financial asset, it must first qualify as **property** in a legal sense, with a clear and enforceable ownership structure. This section establishes the legal framework for analyzing cryptocurrency's status by examining the core principles of ownership and the "bundle of rights" theory in property law.

#### **1.1 The Legal Definition of Ownership**

Ownership, in a legal context, is far more than mere possession. It is a collection of legally recognized and enforceable rights. The Cornell Law School Legal Information Institute defines ownership as "the legal right to use, possess, and give away a thing." [1] This definition highlights the crucial distinction between physical control and legal entitlement. While possession may be a component of ownership, it is not sufficient on its own. True ownership is a legal construct, a set of rights granted and protected by a legal system.

This principle is further clarified in case law. In *Collier v. California Co.*, the court identified three essential elements of complete ownership: "(1) the right to possess, (2) the right to enjoy the use of property, and (3) the right to dispose of property." [2] This tripartite structure underscores the multifaceted nature of ownership. It is not a monolithic concept but a combination of distinct, legally enforceable rights. The absence of any one of these rights significantly diminishes the nature of the ownership interest.

#### **1.2 The Bundle of Rights Theory**

The complexity of property ownership is often explained through the "**bundle of rights**" theory. This legal metaphor, widely taught in U.S. law schools, describes property ownership as a collection of individual rights, or "sticks," that can be separated and reassembled. [3] Each stick represents a specific entitlement, and "full" ownership (fee simple absolute) is the possession of the entire bundle. However, even the most complete form of ownership is subject to certain limitations and restrictions.

The traditional bundle of rights includes five basic property rights:

* **The Right of Possession** (*ius possidendi*): The legal right to be recognized as the owner of the property.
* **The Right of Control** (*ius utendi*): The right to determine how the property is used, subject to legal and contractual limitations.
* **The Right of Exclusion** (*ius prohibendi*): The right to prevent others from entering or using the property.
* **The Right of Enjoyment** (*ius fruendi*): The right to benefit from the property, such as through resource extraction or inhabitation.
* **The Right of Disposition** (*ius disponendi*): The right to transfer ownership to another party, either temporarily (e.g., through a lease) or permanently (e.g., through a sale or inheritance).

This framework is essential for analyzing the legal status of any asset, including cryptocurrency. It requires us to move beyond a simplistic view of ownership as mere possession and instead examine the specific legal rights associated with the asset. As we will see, cryptocurrency's unique technological structure and lack of a clear legal framework present significant challenges to its classification as property in the traditional sense, and by extension, as a financial asset.

### **2. Accounting for Assets: The Principles of Classification**

In the world of accounting, an asset is more than just something of value; it is a resource that is **controlled by an entity** as a result of past events and from which future economic benefits are expected to flow to the entity. This section delves into the accounting principles that govern asset classification, highlighting the critical distinctions between different asset types and the varying approaches of major accounting standards.

#### **2.1 The Definition and Characteristics of an Asset**

According to Investopedia, an asset is "a resource, tangible or intangible, that holds some monetary value that can be exploited by its owner." [4] This definition emphasizes two key characteristics: the asset must have value, and it must be exploitable by its owner. The ability to generate future economic benefits is the cornerstone of the accounting definition of an asset. These benefits can manifest as cash flows, reduced expenses, or improved sales.

A crucial legal requirement underpins this definition: "A company must possess a right to the asset as of the date of its financial statements for it to be counted as one of its assets." [4] This requirement for a legally enforceable right is where the legal and accounting definitions of an asset converge. Without a clear legal claim to the future economic benefits of a resource, it cannot be recognized as an asset on a company's balance sheet.

#### **2.2 The Spectrum of Asset Classes**

Assets are broadly categorized based on their nature and liquidity. The primary asset classes include:

* **Current Assets:** Short-term resources expected to be converted to cash within a year, such as cash, accounts receivable, and inventory.
* **Fixed Assets:** Long-term resources with a life of more than one year, such as property, plant, and equipment.
* **Financial Assets:** Intangible assets that derive their value from a **contractual claim**, such as stocks, bonds, and other securities.
* **Intangible Assets:** Non-physical resources that have economic value, such as patents, trademarks, and copyrights.

Cryptocurrency, being a digital entity, is often compared to financial assets and intangible assets. However, as we will explore, it does not fit neatly into either category.

#### **2.3 US GAAP vs. IFRS: A Tale of Two Frameworks**

The two dominant accounting standards, U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (**US GAAP**) and International Financial Reporting Standards (**IFRS**), take different approaches to classifying financial assets. This divergence is critical to understanding the challenges of classifying cryptocurrency.

* **US GAAP:** Under US GAAP, the legal form of an instrument is the primary driver of its classification. [5] For example, a debt instrument that is a security in legal form is treated differently from a debt instrument that is not, even if their economic substance is similar.
* **IFRS:** In contrast, IFRS 9 emphasizes the **economic substance** of an instrument. [5] The classification of a financial asset is determined by the entity's business model for managing the asset and the asset's contractual cash flow characteristics, regardless of its legal form.

This distinction between legal form and economic substance is at the heart of the debate over cryptocurrency's classification. As we will see, cryptocurrency's unique nature challenges both frameworks, as it lacks both the traditional legal form of a financial asset and the contractual cash flows that are central to the IFRS model.

### **3. The Nature of Financial Assets: A Contractual Claim**

Financial assets form the bedrock of modern economies, facilitating the flow of capital and enabling investment and growth. However, the term "financial asset" has a precise legal and accounting definition that is crucial to understanding why cryptocurrency does not qualify. This section explores the defining characteristics of financial assets, drawing on legal statutes, economic definitions, and accounting standards.

#### **3.1 The Legal and Economic Definition of a Financial Asset**

The U.S. Code defines a financial asset as, among other things, "any equity interest in any pass-thru entity" and, as defined by regulations, "any debt instrument, and (ii) any stock in a corporation." [6] This legal definition, while seemingly technical, reveals a fundamental truth: financial assets are **legal constructs tied to specific entities and legal frameworks**. They are not standalone items of value but rather representations of a claim or interest in a legally recognized entity.

The U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) provides a broader economic definition, describing financial assets as "deposits, stocks, bonds, notes, currencies, and other instruments that possess value and give rise to claims, liabilities, or equity investment." [7] The key phrase here is "**give rise to claims, liabilities, or equity investment**." This underscores the contractual nature of financial assets. They are not valuable in and of themselves; their value is derived from a legally enforceable claim on another party.

#### **3.2 The Core Characteristic: A Contractual Right**

Investopedia provides a concise and insightful definition that encapsulates the essence of a financial asset: "A financial asset is a liquid asset that gets its value from a contractual right or ownership claim." [8] This is the critical distinction that sets financial assets apart from other asset classes. Their value is not intrinsic but is derived from a contract or legal agreement.

This contractual right can take various forms:

* **Stocks:** An ownership claim in a corporation, often conferring voting rights and the right to receive dividends.
* **Bonds:** A contractual right to receive future payments (interest and principal) from an entity.
* **Bank Deposits:** A contractual right to receive money from a bank.

In each of these cases, the value of the asset is inextricably linked to a legally enforceable claim on another party. This is the "**physics**" of finance: for every financial asset, there is a corresponding liability or equity interest on another entity's balance sheet.

#### **3.3 Tangible vs. Intangible Assets: A Critical Distinction**

To further clarify the unique nature of financial assets, it is helpful to contrast them with tangible and other intangible assets.

* **Tangible Assets:** These are assets with a physical form, such as property, plant, and equipment. Their value is often tied to their physical utility.
* **Intangible Assets:** These are non-physical assets that have economic value, such as patents, trademarks, and copyrights. Their value is derived from the legal rights they confer, such as the right to exclude others from using an invention.

Cryptocurrency, being a digital entity, is clearly an **intangible asset**. However, it is crucial to distinguish it from a financial asset. While both are intangible, a financial asset's value is derived from a contractual claim, whereas a traditional intangible asset's value is derived from a legal right of exclusion. As we will see, cryptocurrency possesses neither of these characteristics in a clear and legally enforceable manner.

### **4. The Legal Status of Cryptocurrency: A New, Distinct Form of Property**

Having established the legal and accounting frameworks for asset classification, we now turn our attention to cryptocurrency itself. This section examines the legal status of cryptocurrency, drawing on recent case law and regulatory guidance. It argues that cryptocurrency, while possessing some characteristics of property, represents a new and distinct legal category that does not align with the definition of a financial asset.

#### **4.1 A "New, Distinct Form of Property"**

A landmark 2024 ruling from the English High Court in *Fabrizio D’Aloia v. Persons Unknown* provides a crucial legal framework for understanding cryptocurrency. The court held that cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Tether "can attract property rights under English law." [9] However, the court was clear that this is a "**new, distinct form of property right, not premised on an underlying legal right**." [9] This is a critical distinction. The court explicitly stated that cryptocurrency is "neither a chose in action nor a chose in possession." [9]

This ruling has profound implications for the classification of cryptocurrency. By stating that it is not a "chose in action," the court is saying that cryptocurrency does not represent a contractual right to receive something from another party. This directly contradicts the core definition of a financial asset. The court's finding that cryptocurrency is not a "chose in possession" further distinguishes it from tangible assets, as it lacks a physical form.

The court's conclusion that cryptocurrency is a "new, distinct form of property" is a recognition of its unique nature. It is an acknowledgment that existing legal categories are insufficient to describe this new technology.

#### **4.2 The IRS Classification: Property, Not Currency**

The U.S. Internal Revenue Service (**IRS**) has also provided guidance on the classification of cryptocurrency, and its position is clear: "**For U.S. tax purposes, digital assets are considered property, not currency**." [10] The IRS defines a digital asset as "any digital representation of value recorded on a cryptographically secured, distributed ledger (blockchain) or similar technology." [10] This definition includes cryptocurrencies, stablecoins, and non-fungible tokens (NFTs).

By classifying cryptocurrency as property, the IRS is treating it similarly to other non-financial assets, such as real estate or collectibles. This means that transactions involving cryptocurrency are subject to capital gains and losses, just like the sale of a house or a piece of art. This tax treatment is a strong indicator that the U.S. government does not view cryptocurrency as a financial asset.

#### **4.3 The Absence of a Legal Framework**

Both the English court ruling and the IRS guidance highlight a fundamental challenge with cryptocurrency: the **absence of a comprehensive legal framework**. The *D'Aloia* case notes that cryptocurrency property rights are "not premised on an underlying legal right." [9] This is in stark contrast to traditional financial assets, which are created and governed by a robust legal and regulatory framework.

This absence of a legal framework is not a mere technicality; it is a fundamental barrier to cryptocurrency's classification as a financial asset. Without a clear legal basis for ownership and a contractual claim on another party, cryptocurrency cannot meet the essential criteria of a financial asset.

### **5. Case Law and Regulatory Precedents: The Howey Test and Its Limits**

The legal and regulatory landscape for cryptocurrency is still evolving, but a series of key court cases and regulatory actions have begun to provide some clarity. This section examines these precedents, focusing on the application of the Howey test and the emerging distinctions between different types of cryptocurrencies and digital assets. It argues that these precedents, far from establishing cryptocurrency as a financial asset, actually reinforce its distinct and limited legal status.

#### **5.1 The Howey Test: A 75-Year-Old Standard for a New Technology**

The primary legal framework for determining whether a digital asset is a security in the United States is the **Howey test**, which originated in the 1946 Supreme Court case *SEC v. W.J. Howey Co.* [11] The Howey test defines an "investment contract" as a transaction in which a person (1) invests their money (2) in a common enterprise and (3) is led to expect profits solely from the efforts of the promoter or a third party. If a digital asset is found to be an investment contract, it is considered a **security** and is subject to the full range of securities laws.

#### **5.2 SEC v. Terraform Labs: When Crypto Tokens Are Securities**

The 2023 case *SEC v. Terraform Labs* provides a clear example of when a crypto token can be classified as a security. A New York federal district court held that the **UST, LUNA, wLUNA, and MIR tokens were securities** because they were investment contracts. [12] The court found that the defendants had pooled the proceeds from the sale of these tokens and had led investors to expect profits from their efforts to develop and grow the Terraform ecosystem.

The *Terraform* case is significant because it demonstrates that the Howey test can be applied to crypto tokens. However, it is a crucial distinction that it is the **investment contract**, not the underlying token, that is the security.

#### **5.3 SEC v. Ripple Labs: A Split Decision and Ongoing Uncertainty**

The ongoing case of *SEC v. Ripple Labs* further complicates the legal landscape. In a 2023 ruling, a New York federal district court issued a split decision, finding that some of Ripple's sales of the **XRP token were securities transactions, while others were not**. [13] The court found that Ripple's institutional sales of XRP were securities because the buyers were in a direct contractual relationship with Ripple and had a reasonable expectation of profits from Ripple's efforts. However, the court found that Ripple's programmatic sales of XRP on digital asset exchanges were not securities transactions.

This split decision reinforces the argument that cryptocurrency is not inherently a financial asset. Its legal status is not fixed but is determined by the economic realities of each transaction.

#### **5.4 The Emerging Regulatory Framework: A Patchwork of Rules**

The legal and regulatory framework for cryptocurrency is still a **patchwork of rules and guidance** from various agencies, including the SEC, Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), and IRS. This lack of a unified regulatory framework has created significant uncertainty and is a testament to cryptocurrency's unique and challenging nature.

### **6. Conclusion: The Unbridgeable Chasm**

The evidence presented in this whitepaper leads to a clear and unequivocal conclusion: cryptocurrency, in its current form, **cannot be classified as a true financial asset**. While it possesses some of the characteristics of property and has demonstrated its utility as a medium of exchange, it lacks the fundamental legal and contractual underpinnings that are the hallmarks of traditional financial assets.

The chasm between cryptocurrency and financial assets is not a mere semantic distinction; it is a fundamental difference in their legal and economic nature. **Financial assets are, at their core, contractual claims.** They represent a legally enforceable right to receive a future economic benefit from another party. This contractual relationship is the "physics" of finance, the invisible force that gives financial assets their value and stability.

Cryptocurrency, on the other hand, is a creature of a different realm. Its value is not derived from a contractual claim but from a combination of technological scarcity, market sentiment, and speculative demand.

The legal and regulatory landscape for cryptocurrency is still evolving, but the precedents established so far only serve to reinforce this fundamental distinction. The application of the **Howey test** has shown that some crypto tokens can be classified as securities when they are sold as part of an investment contract, but this is a reflection of the nature of the investment contract, not the inherent nature of the token itself. The split decision in the *Ripple* case further highlights the context-dependent nature of cryptocurrency's legal status.

The implications of this conclusion are profound. For investors, it means that cryptocurrency should be treated as a speculative, high-risk asset, not as a substitute for traditional financial assets. For regulators, it means that a new and tailored regulatory framework is needed to address the unique challenges and risks of this new technology. And for the future of finance, it means that while cryptocurrency may play an important role, it is unlikely to cross the chasm to become a true financial asset without a fundamental change in its legal and economic structure.

As we move forward into an increasingly digital world, it is essential that we have a clear and accurate understanding of the assets that we are creating and trading. This whitepaper has sought to provide that clarity, to illuminate the unbridgeable chasm that separates cryptocurrency from the world of financial assets. The physics of finance, it seems, are not so easily rewritten.
