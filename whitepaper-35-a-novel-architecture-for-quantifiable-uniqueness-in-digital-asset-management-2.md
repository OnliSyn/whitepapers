**Preface: Different from the ground up**

Fundamentally, OnliVault is a hyperdimensional vector storage database that stores Onli. An Onli is a hyperdimensional vector storage container, a tensor-based storage model, arranged as a three-dimensional array of data (analogous to biological DNA structure, hence the name). This is coupled with an unforgeable credential. Computing operations like send or copy, uses a uniqueness quantification algorithm to evolve the container rather than duplicate it. Non-deterministic evolutionary mechanisms as a transfer protocol make the system nearly impervious to prediction, cloning, spoofing, hacking, and other threats, while improving speed and efficiency. This capability makes it possible for an object to maintain a real time, single global state, across a network of connected devices. 

You use Onli to create a non-fungible (unique) document tightly coupled to an unforgeable credential and a protocol. It is a new way to store value (data model and document structure), move it around (protocol rules), and keep it safe (trusted execution environment). 

The web is a network of documents stored on a network of computers. Onli is a network of structured documents (genomes) stored on a network of vaults (trusted execution environments) across a network of devices. This is something very different. Onli is not crypto. A cryptocurrency transaction is a transfer of information made between blockchain addresses. An Onli transaction is an asset transfer, which is a transfer of possession between owners. This is different from the ground up.

### **Abstract**

Hierarchical File Systems (HFS) inherently fail to guarantee the singularity of digital objects, a limitation formalized here as the **Uniqueness-Quantification Problem**. In traditional systems, ensuring availability requires replication of data, but every replicated copy resides under the control of a local super-user (administrator), creating an unavoidable conflict between availability and exclusive control. This paper introduces **Onli**, a decentralized architecture designed to resolve this contradiction. Onli discards the HFS paradigm in favor of a structured tensor-based data object (the **Genome**), an unforgeable capability credential (the **Gene**), and Trusted Execution Environments (called **Vaults**). These components are coordinated by the **Onli One protocol**, which enforces atomic evolve-validate-delete operations to ensure each digital asset maintains a single authoritative instance globally. We analyze Onli’s security model—shifting from perimeter-based file security to capability-based control—and discuss advanced mitigation strategies for remaining trust dependencies. In particular, we explore a hybrid “Triad of Trust” integrating Homomorphic Encryption and Verifiable Computation to augment TEEs, addressing concerns like side-channel attacks and hardware trust. The result is a robust framework that reconciles availability with absolute control, ensuring quantifiable uniqueness of digital assets across distributed environments.

### **1. Introduction: The Uniqueness-Quantification Problem**

Traditional computing relies predominantly on hierarchical file systems (HFS) for data storage and management. While HFS enable organized data access, their design guarantees that data, while reachable and replicable, is never truly controllable by a single authority. In other words, standard systems cannot guarantee that exactly one authoritative instance of a digital object exists across a network at any given time. We refer to this systemic inability as the **Uniqueness-Quantification Problem**, defined as ensuring a digital asset has a unique existence across a network of computers even though computers inherently copy data when transferring it. This problem manifests from several fundamental limitations of HFS-based environments:

* **Unstable Naming and Location**: File systems use external identifiers (filenames) and location-dependent paths. Files are referenced by names and directory paths that can change, leading to broken links or duplicate identifiers. This instability makes it difficult to have a single persistent identity for a data object across the system.
* **Forced Replication for Availability**: Distributed systems prioritize availability and resilience by replicating data across multiple nodes or devices. For example, Hadoop HDFS by default keeps three copies of each file block on different nodes for fault tolerance. Every backup, sync, or distributed file system inherently creates redundant copies of data to prevent loss. This means multiple complete instances of the object exist by design whenever high availability is required.
* **Data Sprawl**: Over time, unstable naming combined with routine replication leads to uncontrolled proliferation of redundant data. Versions and copies of the same file spread across backups, emails, cloud drives, and devices. Governance breaks down as it becomes unclear which copy (if any) is the authoritative one. This sprawl undermines any notion of a unique instance of the object.
* **Super-User Authority Threat**: In standard file systems (e.g. POSIX, NTFS), a local administrator or “root” user can override access controls and view or copy any file on that system. In Unix-like systems, the CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE capability allows privileged processes (like root) to bypass file permission checks and read or write any file. Thus, any replica stored on a machine is ultimately accessible to that machine’s super-user, representing a potential point of total compromise.

These factors imply that in HFS-based environments, one cannot simultaneously achieve both widespread availability of data and exclusive singular control over it. To formalize this: Let F be a digital object. Guaranteeing availability of F in a network implies replication R(F) (at least one copy in addition to the original) to avoid single points of failure. Symbolically, Availability(F) ⇒ ∃R(F). For every host Uᵢ holding a replica R(F), the super-user on that host has full access: SuperUser(Uᵢ) ⇒ FullAccess(R(F)). Therefore, if F is replicated for availability on any typical system, a privileged user on some node can fully access it, defeating exclusive control. In effect, Availability(F) ⇒ ¬Security(F) under the assumptions of HFS. In simpler terms, the goals of high availability and strict exclusive control are mutually exclusive in traditional file systems.

#### **1.1 Formalization**

We summarize the above problem logic:
* **Availability necessitates replication:** Availability(F) ⇒ ∃ R(F)
* **Local privilege breaches control:** ∀ Uᵢ holding R(F), SuperUser(Uᵢ) ⇒ FullAccess(R(F))
* **Hence, availability precludes exclusive security:** Availability(F) ⇒ ¬ Security(F)

A system capable of solving the Uniqueness-Quantification Problem must break this fundamental trade-off. It would need to provide availability without persistent uncontrolled replication, establish data identity that is intrinsic and location-independent, and neutralize the threat of local super-users over stored data. The remainder of this paper introduces Onli, an architecture designed with these very goals in mind.

### **2. The Onli Architecture: A Paradigm Shift**

Onli is a decentralized architecture engineered to provide **quantifiable uniqueness** for digital assets – effectively ensuring there is “only one” authoritative instance of an object in existence across all devices. It achieves this by abandoning the conventional HFS model and redefining how data is structured, identified, and controlled. Onli’s approach represents a fundamental paradigm shift from location-centric security (access based on where data is stored and who manages that location) to object-centric, **capability-based security** (access based on possessing a credential tied to the data itself).

At the core of Onli are three key concepts: the **Genome**, the **Gene**, and the **Vault**. In essence, Onli treats each digital asset as a self-contained, unique data object (**Genome**) coupled with a cryptographic ownership credential (**Gene**), and it confines the storage and modification of that object to a secure enclave environment (**Vault**). This stands in stark contrast to a file in a traditional filesystem: instead of an of an external name and mutable copies scattered across systems, the Genome carries its identity and history internally, and only one instance of it exists network-wide at any time.

Crucially, security in Onli is enforced by the data object itself and cryptographic protocols, rather than by the security of the container (server or filesystem) holding it. This resembles a capability-based security model, where possession of a secret token grants specific rights. In fact, Onli’s Gene is exactly such a token – an unforgeable cryptographic capability that grants control over the associated Genome. Unlike classical Access Control Lists (ACLs) that check permissions against a user identity at a location, Onli does not trust the storage location or its administrator at all. Only possession of the Gene (or a delegated sub-capability) allows any interaction with the Genome. This is a shift from trusting systems to enforcing permissions, to trusting only the math (cryptography) that proves a user is authorized. By tying access directly to keys rather than to identities on a server, capability-based models “push security to the edge,” eliminating large central attack surfaces present in ACL-based systems. Onli embodies this philosophy: the owner’s Gene is the authority, not the server storing the data.

Another paradigm shift is where and how data changes occur. Traditional systems allow editing and copying of files in an uncontrolled manner on any machine by privileged users. Onli instead mandates that all changes (such as transferring ownership) happen inside a secure computation vault and follow a strict protocol. The goal is that the system state evolves without ever creating a second persistent copy of an asset. This is analogous to how a blockchain transaction transfers a single token without duplicating it – except that Onli manages the asset itself rather than just a ledger entry. In fact, Onli was designed to solve a different problem than distributed ledgers (DLTs): rather than maintaining a shared ledger of multiple copies, it maintains a singular data object. Once true uniqueness of a digital asset is achievable, one can get the benefits of blockchain (trustless decentralization, asset uniqueness) without the downsides like heavy consensus overhead. Onli’s approach avoids the need for energy-intensive miners or global consensus algorithms; trust is established through hardware isolation and cryptographic verification instead of network-wide agreement.

In summary, Onli shifts the paradigm along several axes: from files to self-contained data objects, from paths/ACL security to capability security, from replicate-then-sync to transfer-without-copy, and from trusting system administrators to trusting hardware and cryptography.

---

### **3. Core Components**

The architecture of Onli is built on three primary components, each replacing a traditional element of computing systems:

* **Genome** (Data Model) – replaces the traditional “file” or data container.
* **Gene** (Credential) – replaces user identity and access control tokens.
* **Vault** (Trusted Execution Environment) – replaces the vulnerable general-purpose execution environment where a super-user could interfere.

Each of these components works together to enforce the uniqueness and security properties of Onli.

#### **3.1 The Genome Data Model**

The **Genome** is a structured, self-contained digital asset that holds not only the content but also its own identity, metadata, and history intrinsically. In Onli, a Genome serves the role of a “file,” but unlike a file, it encapsulates rich information about itself in a fixed schema. The Genome uses a tensor-based storage model, conceptually arranged as a three-dimensional array of data (analogous to biological DNA structure, hence the name).

Specifically, it can be envisioned as a 10×10×2 matrix of data elements:
* First dimension – **Helices** (10): ten categories of information, each called a “helix,” that organize the Genome’s metadata and content.
* Second dimension – **Base-pairs** (10 per helix): each helix contains ten entries or slots.
* Third dimension – **Elements** (2 per entry): each base-pair slot stores two pieces of data (for example, an attribute and its value).

This fixed-size tensor design ensures that crucial information about the asset is always present and structured. Important helices within the Genome include:
* The **identiTY Helix**, which contains immutable identifiers for the Genome (for instance, a unique ID or hash that intrinsically names this object – avoiding reliance on external filenames or paths).
* The **Owner Helix**, which records the complete lineage of ownership of the asset.
* The **Heredity Helix**, which is essentially a log of state changes or “edits” to the Genome over time. This forms an immutable chain of the Genome’s evolution.
* The **State Helix**, which records the Genome’s current status, such as its current owner (linking to the Gene holder) and the current Vault location where it resides.

Each helix (indeed, each base-pair entry) can be sealed with a cryptographic hash or signature covering its contents, making the Genome tamper-evident internally. The Genome is always treated as a singular, atomic unit of data – it is not meant to be partially copied or merged with others. By having identity, provenance, and state as part of the object itself, Onli eliminates the external naming problem: the object carries its unique identity wherever it goes, and that identity does not depend on any particular file path or server location. In effect, the Genome is a **non-fungible data structure** – there is meant to be no other structure exactly like it, and it cannot be duplicated without breaking its internal consistency.

#### **3.2 The Gene (Capability-Based Credential)**

The **Gene** is an unforgeable cryptographic credential associated with a Genome, effectively representing the “owner” or controller of that Genome. In traditional systems, a user’s permissions to access a file are determined by checking an ACL or access policy on the file. Onli replaces that with a capability-based security model: the Gene is a token that grants the capability to interact with the Genome. Possession of the Gene (specifically the cryptographic keys it contains) is the only thing that authorizes an entity to perform actions on the corresponding Genome.

Technically, a Gene is itself a special instance of a Genome – it follows the same 10×10×2 structured model, but its content is geared toward authentication and authorization data. The Gene stores things like the owner’s public and private key material, recent transaction records (to prevent replay attacks), and any delegated rights. Because Genes are cryptographic, they implement the principle of least authority by default: having a Gene allows exactly the operations it is designed to allow, nothing more.

In practice, using a Gene is akin to using a private key to sign a transaction: to modify or transfer a Genome, the operation must be signed by the current owner’s Gene keys, proving authorization. This is in line with existing capability-security paradigms and even cryptocurrency models (where possession of a private key is ownership of the funds). A capability is often described as an “unforgeable token of authority” – the Gene fits this description exactly. It cannot be forged due to cryptographic protections, and it eliminates the need for the system to consult a central ACL or trust a super-user: if you don’t have the Gene (or a valid delegated token from it), you simply cannot access the Genome.

One major advantage here is that security becomes decentralized and personalized – the user’s Gene is under their control (often stored client-side in a secure wallet or hardware module). There is no dependence on a central server to authenticate you; the system only verifies that your presented Gene cryptographically matches the Genome’s expected owner. Another advantage is revocation and delegation become easier to manage: an owner can delegate a capability by issuing a signed sub-token from their Gene or revoke it by evolving their Gene (which would invalidate previous tokens). Because Genes evolve state after each transaction, any stolen or old credentials become unusable after they’ve been rotated.

In summary, the Gene replaces user accounts and ACLs with a capability-based key. It ensures that control of a digital asset is enforced cryptographically (mathematically), not merely by OS policy.

#### **3.3 The Vault (Trusted Execution Environment)**

The **Vault** is the secure storage and processing environment in which Genomes reside and where all authorized operations on them are executed. In implementation terms, a Vault is a **Trusted Execution Environment (TEE)**, such as an Intel SGX enclave or an AMD SEV secure virtualization, or a specialized hardware security module. The purpose of the Vault is to protect the Genome from the host system it’s on – including that system’s administrator.

A TEE like Intel SGX provides a hardware-isolated enclave in memory: an enclave is an isolated region of code and data such that even the operating system or a hypervisor cannot read or alter its contents while it is running. This means that if a Genome is loaded inside an enclave (the Vault), even a malicious root user or malware on the host cannot directly extract the plaintext data or tamper with the code executing the Onli protocol. The Vault thus neutralizes the Super-User Threat identified earlier. No matter who “owns” the physical machine or has admin rights, they cannot arbitrarily copy or inspect the Genomes inside the Vault because the hardware and CPU enforce the isolation. In essence, the Vault treats the host operating system as an untrusted adversary.

Another critical feature provided by TEEs and hence by Onli Vaults is **Remote Attestation**. This is a mechanism where the Vault can prove to a remote party (e.g., the current owner of a Genome) that it is running genuine, untampered Onli code in a genuine secure enclave. Onli leverages this so that before a Genome is entrusted to a Vault, the owner can verify that the destination Vault is authentic and secure. Only if attestation passes will the system proceed with moving the Genome.

Within the Vault, the Onli One protocol (described next) is executed. The Vault provides a safe space for performing the Genome Editing operations – the host cannot intervene or extract data mid-process. Because the Vault’s code is known and verified, we can trust that it will delete the source after a successful transfer, update the state correctly, and so forth. Essentially, the Vault enforces that the only way a Genome can be manipulated is through the approved protocol steps, shielding it from any external attempts to copy or tamper. By confining critical operations to TEEs, Onli shifts trust from fallible human-controlled software systems to a combination of hardware and rigorous protocol.

### **4. The Onli One Protocol: Enforcing Singularity**

The **Onli One protocol** is the transaction mechanism that coordinates how Genomes are transferred or modified across the network in a way that preserves their singular existence. The core challenge it addresses is: how do you move or update data on different nodes without ever having two valid copies at the same time? Onli One achieves this by redefining standard data operations and introducing an atomic evolve-validate-delete sequence for any change in a Genome’s state.

#### **4.1 Evolution vs. Duplication**

In conventional systems, if you want to send a file to someone, you typically end up with two copies. Onli takes the stance that duplication of the authoritative data is never allowed to persist. Instead of copying, Onli uses an **evolution** approach: the data object (Genome) “evolves” from one state to the next. When you transfer a Genome, you’re not making a carbon copy; you are transforming the original object into a new instance that reflects the change (such as new owner, new location), and the old instance is rendered invalid or destroyed. This process is called Genome Editing in Onli terminology.

For example, consider transferring ownership of a digital asset from Alice to Bob in Onli. The transfer would involve evolving the Genome’s Owner helix to replace “Alice” with “Bob” and updating the Heredity log. This produces a new cryptographic state for the Genome, and the new state is bound to Bob. Once this evolution is validated, the original instance in Alice’s Vault is scheduled for deletion. There is never a point where two valid, up-to-date copies of the Genome are in different places – instead, the state has shifted from being “Alice’s copy in Alice’s Vault” to “Bob’s copy in Bob’s Vault.” The old state (Alice’s) is obsolete. Thus, the system maintains a singular global state for that asset.

#### **4.2 Atomic Transfer Mechanism (Evolve-Validate-Delete)**

To rigorously ensure that no duplicate persists, the Onli One protocol implements an atomic three-step process for any transfer or state-change of a Genome: **Evolve, Validate, Delete**. These steps occur across the source Vault (where the Genome currently resides) and the destination Vault (where it’s moving), and they must be completed as one indivisible transaction – if any step fails, the system aborts and rolls back to a single valid instance.

* **Evolve**: The destination Vault prepares to receive the Genome by evolving it. The destination Vault computes the new Genome state that it should have once the operation is done. At this stage, the Genome inside the destination is essentially a candidate new instance.
* **Validate**: Validation is a critical checkpoint. The destination Vault now has a would-be new Genome; it must prove to the source (and the broader system or any auditing layer) that this new Genome is a faithful evolution of the old one. Cryptographic checks are performed. Onli also mentions a **Replicated Validation Oracle (RVO)** – an external audit log that can be consulted to ensure global state consistency. If anything is amiss, the process aborts here.
* **Delete**: Upon successful validation, the protocol finalizes by deleting the original instance from the source Vault. This step is what ensures uniqueness: after deletion, only the destination Vault has the live Genome.

All three steps must occur as an atomic unit. If a failure or interruption occurs before the delete step, the system will recognize that two copies might exist. In such cases, Onli’s design is to prevent divergence: it could either roll back or pause and require manual resolution using the RVO log. This is similar to how a two-phase commit (2PC) protocol in database systems ensures atomicity across nodes.

It’s worth noting the contrast with how distributed ledger systems handle transfers. Onli achieves a similar guarantee to a blockchain, but not through consensus – instead through secure enclaves and point-to-point atomic transactions. This means transfers in Onli can be fast (no waiting for global consensus rounds) and energy-efficient.

To summarize, the Onli One protocol redefines data transfer as a state evolution performed under hardware-enforced conditions. By evolving instead of copying, validating cryptographically, and deleting the old instance, it ensures that even as data moves freely, there is at most one authoritative copy at any time. This directly solves the Uniqueness-Quantification Problem: availability (you can still transfer and thus have the data elsewhere) is achieved without persistent replication (the old copy is gone).

---

### **5. Security Analysis and the Control Paradigm**

Onli’s approach requires rethinking security from protecting locations (servers, filesystems) to enforcing control over objects. Traditional security models often focus on guarding the perimeter. Onli’s model instead treats every location as potentially compromised and shifts the focus to the asset itself: only the holder of the right cryptographic gene can use the asset, and the asset can only live within secure vaults. We term this shift from “security” to “control.”

#### **5.1 The Control Paradigm vs. Traditional Security**

In an HFS/ACL world, security is identity-based and location-based. Onli flips this model. Instead of trying to make the storage location impenetrable, it makes the data object itself self-securing. The Genome is encrypted and its modifications are confined to Vaults. The Gene ensures that even if someone gets hold of the encrypted Genome file, they can’t use it unless they also somehow obtained the owner’s keys. This is an example of **capability-based control**: only possessing the right capability (the Gene key) lets you do something. It drastically narrows the attack surface, because an attacker now has to specifically target the credentials or break the enclave.

In practice, this means Onli defines a finite set of allowed actions on an asset, and each action requires presenting the appropriate Gene capability. The Vault will simply not execute any operation for which it doesn’t see a valid cryptographic authorization. There’s no “root override” in the Vault. In other words, possession of data is decoupled from ability to use data – a fundamental goal of robust security.

There is still the need for trust, of course, but it’s shifted. Instead of trusting sysadmins and network firewalls, you trust math and hardware. You trust that the cryptography is not broken and that the enclave’s isolation holds. This is generally a safer bet. By quantifying every operation and requiring a Gene, Onli can actually measure security in terms of who had control when, rather than hoping no unauthorized access occurred.

#### **5.2 Cryptographic Verification Mechanisms**

Onli employs multiple layers of cryptographic verification to ensure that only valid operations occur and that they are globally consistent. Some key techniques include:

* **Public Key Cryptography & Signatures**: Each Gene essentially contains a public/private key pair. When an owner initiates an operation, their Gene’s private key must sign the operation. The Vault verifies this signature against the known public key.
* **Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs)**: An owner might use a ZKP to prove to a Vault that they possess a valid Gene private key without revealing the key itself. ZKPs could also allow a Vault to prove to another party that it performed a transfer correctly without revealing the asset’s data.
* **Schnorr Signatures & Multi-Signatures**: Schnorr signatures are used for their efficiency and support of multiparty signatures (multiple keys can jointly sign a single transaction).
* **Canonical Encoding & Oracle Verification (RVO)**: When state changes occur, they are encoded in a standard form and sent to the **Replicated Validation Oracle (RVO)**. The RVO is like an audit ledger that can be consulted to resolve disputes or to double-check that a claimed state is indeed the latest.

Through these measures, Onli’s security model emphasizes integrity and non-repudiation. Every state change is signed and logged; every access is authorized via unforgeable keys.

---

### **6. Failure Modes and Advanced Mitigation Strategies**

No security architecture is perfect. Onli’s design acknowledges several potential failure modes, including TEE/HSM vulnerabilities and protocol atomicity failures.

#### **6.1 TEE/HSM Vulnerabilities**

The Vault’s security is paramount. Trusted Execution Environments are robust but not invulnerable. Researchers have demonstrated numerous **side-channel attacks** against SGX enclaves, including:

* **Speculative execution side-channels**: These attacks exploit how modern CPUs attempt to execute instructions ahead of time, potentially leaking information from a secure enclave. Attacks like Foreshadow (L1TF) and CacheOut have succeeded in extracting enclave data under lab conditions.
* **Memory access pattern channels**: A malicious OS could observe memory access patterns to deduce what the enclave was doing.
* **Hardware bugs and rogue insiders**: There is a risk of microcode or design flaws that could be exploited.

If a TEE is compromised, an attacker could potentially extract a Genome’s plaintext, thus violating uniqueness and confidentiality. Onli’s first line of defense is to keep TEE firmware updated and to structure enclave code to minimize side-channel leakage.

#### **6.2 Protocol Atomicity Failures**

Another failure mode to consider is if the atomic transfer protocol fails in the middle. If a system crashes after the new Vault has evolved and validated a Genome, but before the source Vault deletes its copy, temporarily two copies exist. Onli addresses this by using a robust commit protocol for transfers, akin to a distributed transaction with two-phase commit. The **Replicated Validation Oracle (RVO)** acts as a source of truth to resolve these scenarios.

#### **6.3 Advanced Mitigation: The “Triad of Trust” (TEE + FHE + ZKP)**

To further fortify the system, we propose a composite approach that layers additional cryptographic protections. We call this the **Triad of Trust**, combining: (1) Trusted Execution Environments (**TEEs**) for isolated execution, (2) Fully Homomorphic Encryption (**FHE**) for data confidentiality even during processing, and (3) Verifiable Computation (via Zero-Knowledge Proofs or **ZKPs**) for ensuring computational integrity.

* **TEEs**: Remain the cornerstone for execution isolation. Their role is to provide a secure environment and attestation that the protocol is running as intended.
* **FHE**: Allows computations to be performed directly on encrypted data. In an FHE-enhanced Onli, even if an attacker compromised the TEE, they would only see encrypted blobs that they cannot decipher. This directly tackles side-channel vulnerabilities.
* **Verifiable Computation / ZKPs**: Ensures that the Vault performs the correct computation on the encrypted data. After the computation, the Vault can output a succinct proof (a zk-SNARK) that it correctly executed the protocol logic without revealing any data. This proof can be checked independently.

In combination, these three mechanisms provide defense-in-depth: the TEE gives a secure environment, FHE ensures data is never in plaintext, and ZKPs prove the computation was correct. This multi-layered approach mitigates even sophisticated attacks, albeit with a performance trade-off.

### **7. Comparative Analysis**

To better understand Onli’s significance, it’s useful to compare its features with traditional Hierarchical File Systems (HFS) and Distributed Ledger Technology (blockchains).

#### **7.1 Onli vs. Hierarchical File Systems**

| Feature | Traditional HFS | Onli Architecture |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Identifier** | External and unstable (filenames, paths) | Intrinsic and stable (Genome identiTY helix) |
| **Replication** | Required for availability; leads to data sprawl | Eliminated via evolve-validate-delete transfers |
| **Security Model** | Location-based access control (ACLs) | Capability-based control (Gene credentials) |
| **Super-User Threat** | Admin can override permissions and access files | Neutralized by Vaults (TEEs) |
| **Uniqueness** | Cannot be guaranteed or quantified | Quantified and enforced by protocol |

Onli is designed to explicitly solve the weaknesses of HFS in terms of data uniqueness and control.

#### **7.2 Onli vs. Distributed Ledger Technology (Blockchain)**

| Feature | Distributed Ledger Technology | Onli Architecture |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **What is managed** | A ledger of transactions; asset data is off-chain | The asset itself (the Genome) is managed directly |
| **Trust mechanism** | Distributed consensus (e.g., PoW, PoS) | Hardware trust (TEEs) and point-to-point protocol |
| **Decentralization** | Fully decentralized; anyone can join and verify | Federated and more private; trust is in the device |
| **Performance** | Limited throughput and high latency | Fast, with potential for millisecond finality |
| **Security model** | Secure as long as >50% of miners are honest | Secure as long as hardware isn’t compromised |

Onli is not a blockchain, but a new category. It aims to get the benefit of one-of-a-kind digital objects without the overhead and complexity of consensus networks.

### **8. Conclusion**

The Uniqueness-Quantification Problem has long been a fundamental limitation of traditional computing environments. Onli presents a comprehensive solution by ensuring a digital asset can be available while still being unique.

Onli achieves this through a combination of innovations: a novel data structure (**Genome**), a capability-based security token (**Gene**), and the use of Trusted Execution Environments (**Vaults**) to carry out state transitions. The **Onli One protocol** orchestrates transfers with an atomic evolve-validate-delete sequence, guaranteeing that only one instance of the Genome remains.

The security paradigm of Onli shifts focus from defending systems to maintaining control over objects. By embracing capability-based security and a zero-trust approach, Onli significantly reduces risks from insider threats and malware. To address the remaining vulnerabilities, we analyzed how a "Triad of Trust" using **FHE** and **ZK proofs** can bolster the confidentiality and integrity of operations.

In comparing Onli with existing paradigms, it becomes evident that Onli carves out a niche for scenarios where digital uniqueness and precise control are paramount. Unlike standard file systems, it can actually enforce “only one exists” for a piece of data. Unlike blockchains, it manages the data itself and can operate with far less overhead.

The conflict between availability and control is not an insurmountable paradox after all. With Onli, we can have both.
